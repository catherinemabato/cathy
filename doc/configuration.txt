  For DOSEMU v1.0 pl0.0

  DOSEmu Configuration

  Running './setup-dosemu' from this directory will allow you to
  configure both the compilation and the run-time aspects of DOSEmu.
  When changing the run-time settings of DOSEmu you can set both the
  system wide settings and your personal settings.  Even better, the
  program will automatically tell you your current settings or suggest
  defaults where possible.

  The program needs Tcl/Tk, take care to have it available on your
  system.
