ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 0.64.1, the PC Emulator for
x86 based *nix. Please remember to consider this as ALPHA software.


WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine. This allows you to run
many DOS applications. These are capabilities of DOSEMU worth noting:

  - Color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) via terminal.
  - Built-in X-Windows support, includes IBM character set font!
  - Graphics capability at the console with most compatible video cards.
  - Much-improved DPMI support.
  - Runs Borland BCC.EXE/TCC.EXE version 3.x command line compilers!
  - Runs Borlandc C++ 3.x IDE (with emumodule.o)
  - Runs several 32-bit DPMI-compilant video games, including DOS/4GW,
     at the Linux console.
  - NetBSD verison of DOSEMU appreciating a growing success,
     contact jtk@atria.com.
  - CDROM support.
  - NetWare and other network connectivity via builtin IPX and pktdrvr
     support.



REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Linux 2.0.0+ (with IPC support, IPX support optional)
  - Linux >= 2.1.8 is also supported now (patch supplied for 'full feature')
  - GCC 2.7.0+ and LIBC 5.2.18+ are recommended for best results.
  - Plenty of swap, since DOSEMU requires between 12 and 25 megabytes
     of total memory to compile, depending on configuration.
