ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 1.1.5,
the PC Emulator for x86 based *nix.

SPECIAL HIGHLIGHT starting from 1.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the first time in it's history, DOSEMU now deserves it's name because it
distributes together with a specially tailored FreeDos distribution, allowing
it to run out-of-the-box without further (painful) configuration.
This collection is an almost complete replacement for a proprietary XX-DOS
and will run a wide range of DOS applications.

WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine. This allows you to run
many DOS applications. These are the capabilities of DOSEMU that are
worth noting:

  - Color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) even on terminal.
  - Built-in X-Windows support (includes IBM character set font)
  - Graphics capability at the console (most compatible video cards).
    (requires suid-root or sudo)
  - Graphics emulation in X for 256 and 16 color modes.
    (X-server may be in true color mode)
  - DPMI support
  - Runs several 32-bit DPMI-compliant video games (including those based
    on DOS/4GW) at the Linux console (suid-root) and on X (non-suid).
  - integrated (command line) instruction level debugger, various break
    points, single stepping etc.
  - integrated EMS driver
  - integrated packet driver
  - integrated mouse driver
  - CDROM support.
  - ASPI driver support (CD writers, scanners, tapes etc.)
    (requires access rigths to /dev/sgX)
  - support for redirected drives (any Linux directory can be 'mounted'
    as DOS drive as ,ong as the DOS support redirection.
  - can even directly boot from a Linux directory containing all DOS stuff.
  - Sound support (including sound DMA)
  - NetWare and other network connectivity via builtin IPX and pktdrvr
     support.
  - integrated COMMAND.COM (running 32bit to spare valuable DOS memory)
    with lots of DOSEMU support builtin commands.
  - dosemu-freedos packaged binary distribution installs directly into any
    normal user's $HOME and runs 'out-of-the-box' without any further
    configuration (no root rights needed).



REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Linux >= 2.0.30 (with IPC support, IPX support optional)
  - any DOS to boot (FreeDos is contained in the binary distribution)

When compiling dosemu yourself:
  - GCC 2.91.66+ and glibc 2.1.3+ are required.
  - binutils > 2.9.1.0.25
  - bison, _not_ yacc

  ... and others too important to mention.

Special thanks for this 1.0.2 release go to Bart Oldeman (DOSEMU team member
and now also maintainer of FD kernel) and Pat Villani (original author of
the code which makes the FD kernel: DosC). Without their special efforts
the current out-of-the-box binary distribution of DOSEMU never would have
been possible. As it is now, it is a really working replacement for XX-DOS.

Of course, all those people involved in the FreeDos development should be
mentioned here too, but before I fail to mention some of them, I better point
you to http://www.freedos.org ;-)


WHERE TO GET IT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU PC Emulator can be downloaded from the following FTP sites:

  ftp.dosemu.org://dosemu/...
  ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/emulators/dosemu/...
                                     .../README.bindist
                                     .../dosemu-freedos-bin.tgz
                                     .../dosemu-1.0.2-bin.tgz
                                     .../dosemu-1.0.2.tgz

The binary distribution is statically linked against libc-5.4.46 and libX*
from XFree-3.3. It should run on all current Linux distributions.
