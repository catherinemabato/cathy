ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 0.98.1, the PC Emulator for
x86 based *nix. Please remember to consider this as ALPHA software.


WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine. This allows you to run
many DOS applications. These are the capabilities of DOSEMU that are
worth noting:

  - Color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) even on terminal.
  - Built-in X-Windows support (includes IBM character set font)
  - Graphics capability at the console (most compatible video cards).
  - Graphics emulation in X for 256 color modes.
    (X-server may be in true color mode)
  - DPMI support
  - able to run (handicapped) Windows-3.1 either on console or in X.
    (you need the os2win31.zip package, and licenses for both,
    Windows-3.1 and OS/2. see doc/README.Windows)
  - Runs Borland BCC.EXE/TCC.EXE version 3.x command line compilers!
  - Runs Borland C++ 3.x IDE
  - Runs several 32-bit DPMI-compliant video games (including those based
    on DOS/4GW) at the Linux console.
  - CDROM support.
  - Sound support (including sound DMA)
  - NetWare and other network connectivity via builtin IPX and pktdrvr
     support.
  - runs on any Linux kernel >= 2.0.28 (last tested was 2.1.120)

WHAT IS NEW against version 0.66.7?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - simpler and more user friendly configuration (a lot of former
    dosemu.conf stuff is auto-detected by the new configuration script
    global.conf, however, people with deeper knowledge of DOSEMU can fine
    tune this script to fit their special private needs).
    The new Tcl/Tk based configuration tool makes configuration quicker.
  - all security problems now can be solved via appropriate configuration
    and DOSEMU now can run non-suid-root (some features will be unavailable).
  - support for per user DOSEMU directories.
  - Improved graphics capability under X (including mouse support,
    LFB and VESA support, resizing, e.t.c).
  - Better handling of non-US keyboards, both in X and on terminal,
    loadable key-tables. More national key-tables.
  - more supported graphic cards under raw console mode.
  - more precise timer emulation (using the pentium cycle counter where 
    available)
  - better sound support
  - more features for the builtin debugger (dosdebug).
  - major portions of the code have been rewritten and cleaned up.
  - glibc adaptation (though, we haven't checked today's changes yet;-).
  - ... and finally, lots of bugs are fixed and more DOS-applications
    are running than ever before.


REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Linux >= 2.0.28 (with IPC support, IPX support optional)
  - mtools-3.8 (for creating hdimages and DEXEs)

When compiling dosemu yourself:
  - GCC 2.7.2+ and LIBC 5.4.7+ are recommended for best results.
  - Plenty of swap, since DOSEMU requires between 12 and 25 megabytes
     of total memory to compile, depending on configuration.

WHERE TO GET IT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU PC Emulator can be downloaded from the following FTP sites:

  ftp.dosemu.org:/dosemu/...
  tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/...
                                     .../dosemu-0.98.1-bin.tgz
                                     .../dosemu-0.98.1.tgz

The binary distribution is statically linked against libc-5.4.33 and libX*
from XFree-3.3. It should run on all current Linux distributions.
