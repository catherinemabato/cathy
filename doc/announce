ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 1.0, the PC Emulator for
x86 based *nix. Please remember to consider this as ALPHA software.


WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine. This allows you to run
many DOS applications. These are the capabilities of DOSEMU that are
worth noting:

  - Color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) even on terminal.
  - Built-in X-Windows support (includes IBM character set font)
  - Graphics capability at the console (most compatible video cards).
  - Graphics emulation in X for 256 color modes.
    (X-server may be in true color mode)
  - DPMI support
  - Runs several 32-bit DPMI-compliant video games (including those based
    on DOS/4GW) at the Linux console.
  - integrated (command line) instruction level debugger, various break
    points, single stepping e.t.c.
  - integrated EMS driver
  - integrated packet driver
  - integrated mouse driver
  - CDROM support.
  - ASPI driver support (CD writers, scanners, tapes e.t.c)
  - support for redirected drives (any Linux directory can be 'mounted'
    as DOS drive as ,ong as the DOS support redirection.
  - can even directly boot from a Linux directory containing all DOS stuff.
  - Sound support (including sound DMA)
  - NetWare and other network connectivity via builtin IPX and pktdrvr
     support.
  - runs on any Linux kernel >= 2.0.28 (last tested was 2.3.40)



REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Linux >= 2.0.28 (with IPC support, IPX support optional)
  - mtools-3.8 (for creating hdimages and DEXEs)

When compiling dosemu yourself:
  - GCC 2.7.2+ and LIBC 5.4.46+ are recommended for best results.
    (statically linked in libc-5.4.46 binaries perform better and
    give stabler results)
  - Plenty of swap, since DOSEMU requires between 12 and 25 megabytes
     of total memory to compile, depending on configuration.

WHERE TO GET IT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU PC Emulator can be downloaded from the following FTP sites:

  ftp.dosemu.org:/dosemu/...
  ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/emulators/dosemu/...
                                     .../dosemu-1.0.0-1.i386.rpm
                                     .../dosemu-1.0.0.tgz

The binary distribution is statically linked against libc-5.4.46 and libX*
from XFree-3.3. It should run on all current Linux distributions.
