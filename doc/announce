ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 1.1.2,
the PC Emulator for x86 based *nix.


WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine. This allows you to run
many DOS applications. These are the capabilities of DOSEMU that are
worth noting:

  - Color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) even on terminal.
  - Built-in X-Windows support (includes IBM character set font)
  - Graphics capability at the console (most compatible video cards).
  - Graphics emulation in X for 256 and 16 color modes.
    (X-server may be in true color mode)
  - DPMI support
  - Runs several 32-bit DPMI-compliant video games (including those based
    on DOS/4GW) at the Linux console.
  - integrated (command line) instruction level debugger, various break
    points, single stepping e.t.c.
  - integrated EMS driver
  - integrated packet driver
  - integrated mouse driver
  - CDROM support.
  - ASPI driver support (CD writers, scanners, tapes e.t.c)
  - support for redirected drives (any Linux directory can be 'mounted'
    as DOS drive as ,ong as the DOS support redirection.
  - can even directly boot from a Linux directory containing all DOS stuff.
  - Sound support (including sound DMA)
  - NetWare and other network connectivity via builtin IPX and pktdrvr
     support.
  - integrated COMMAND.COM (running 32bit to spare valuable DOS memory)
    with lot of DOSEMU support builtin commands.
  - dosemu-freedos packaged binary distribution installs directly into any
    normal user's $HOME and runs 'out-of-the-box' without any further
    configuration (no root rights needed).
  - runs on any Linux kernel >= 2.0.28 (last tested was 2.4.3)



REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Linux >= 2.0.28 (with IPC support, IPX support optional)

When compiling dosemu yourself:
  - GCC 2.7.2+ and LIBC 5.4.46+ are recommended for best results.
    Though glibc-2.x may be used, statically libc-5.4.46 linked binaries
    perform better and give much stabler results.
  - Plenty of swap, since DOSEMU requires between 12 and 25 megabytes
    of total memory to compile, depending on configuration.

WHERE TO GET IT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU PC Emulator can be downloaded from the following FTP sites:

  ftp.dosemu.org://dosemu/...
  ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/emulators/dosemu/...
                                     .../README.bindist
                                     .../dosemu-freedos-bin.tgz
                                     .../dosemu-1.0.2-bin.tgz
                                     .../dosemu-1.0.2.tgz

The binary distribution is statically linked against libc-5.4.46 and libX*
from XFree-3.3. It should run on all current Linux distributions.
