ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 0.63.2, the PC Emulator for
x86 based *nix. Please remember to consider this as ALPHA software.


WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine. This allows you to run
many DOS applications. These are capabilities of DOSEMU worth noting:

  - Color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) via terminal.
  - Built-in X-Windows support, includes IBM character set font!
  - Graphics capability at the console with most compatible video cards.
  - Much-improved DPMI support.
  - Runs Borland BCC.EXE/TCC.EXE version 3.x command line compilers!
  - Runs Borlandc C++ 3.x IDE (with emumodule.o)
  - Runs several 32-bit DPMI-compilant video games, including DOS/4GW,
     at the Linux console.
  - NetBSD verison of DOSEMU appreciating a growing success,
     contact jtk@atria.com.
  - CDROM support.
  - NetWare and other network connectivity via builtin IPX and pktdrvr
     support.



REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Linux 1.1.45+ (with IPC support, IPX support optional)
  - GCC 2.5.8+ and LIBC 4.5.21+ are recommended for best results.
  - Plenty of swap, since DOSEMU requires between 12 and 25 megabytes
     of total memory to compile, depending on configuration.

WHERE TO GET IT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU PC Emulator can be downloaded from the following FTP sites:

  tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/dosemu0.63.2.tgz
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Emulators/dosemu0.63.2.tgz


TO BE NOTED:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This release is considered as the stepping stone for the team to cut
off using the old developement directory structure and working towards
this new and improved layout. This was likely noticed by us being away
from civilization as work progressed to the new format. The work isn't
fully done yet, but since the demand for a new release grew after
Linux 2.0 came out, we decided to make this interim release.
Please have patience for approximately the next month.
