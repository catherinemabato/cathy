ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 0.60, the PC Emulator for Linux!



WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine.  This allows you to run
many DOS applications.  These are capabilities of DOSEMU worth noting:

  - Color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) via terminal
  - Built-in X-Windows support, includes IBM character set font!
  - Graphics capability at the console with most compatible video cards.
  - Much-improved DPMI support.
  - Runs Borland BCC.EXE / TCC.EXE version 3.x command line compilers!
  - Runs several 32-bit DPMI-compilant video games, including DOS/4GW,
     at the Linux console.  A partial list of successfully tested games 
     includes DOOM2, Heretic, Descent, MK2, OMF2097, ROTT, and WarCraft!
  - Games runs *MUCH* faster in dosemu due to improved timer emulation
  - FreeBSD verison of DOSEMU under development, contact jtk@atria.com
  - CDROM support



REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Linux 1.1.31+ (with IPC support, IPX support optional)
  - GCC 2.6.3 and LIBC 4.6.27 are recommended for best results.
  - Plenty of swap, since DOSEMU requires between 12 and 25 megabytes
     of total memory to compile, depending on Makefile configuration.



CREDITS

  Marty Leisner         James B. Maclean      



WHERE TO GET IT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU PC Emulator can be downloaded from the following FTP sites
when version 0.60.0 arrives on April the 1st:

  tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/dosemu0.60.tgz
  dspsun.eas.asu.edu:/pub/dosemu/dosemu0.60.tgz
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Emulators/dosemu0.60.tgz

We expect to see DOSEMU being included as an extra with many Linux 
Distribution packages.



IMPORTANT NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you haven't used DOSEMU in several months (Especially if the last 
version you used was DOSEMU 0.52 or earlier), please go to great
caution to read the "QuickStart" file included with DOSEMU since 
the location and format of files (including the configuration file) has 
changed since the DOSEMU 0.50pl1.  

While DOSEMU may be more stable than many of the previous releases, it
must be noted that it is still possible to crash the Linux video and 
keyboard, if you don't follow instructions properly.  In this case, it
becomes necessary to use a remote terminal or even the RESET button,
to reboot the system.

The main risks of DOSEMU are the 'graphics' capability and 'rawkeyboard'.
These can be disabled in the DOSEMU configuration file, to make DOSEMU
become bullet-proof, at the cost of some convenience.
