With only a couple weeks delay, here is DOSEMU 0.50. This release
should prove to be a bit more stable than 0.49pl4, and add a much
improved serial interface. Other code clean up, and added functionality
should persuade everyone to upgrade to this release, as long as they
have a kernel 0.99pl14+.

  DOSEMU is a Linux specific application that allows Linux to run many
DOS based programs. It requires a bootable DOS diskette and
Linux 0.99pl14+ .

  Definitely still consider this ALPHA software, and as such please
beware it is not yet fully functional, or always smooth sailing.

At this time, it should be locatable at:

dspsun.eas.asu.edu:/pub/dosemu/dosemu0.50.tgz
Thanks to deisher@enws125.EAS.ASU.EDU (Michael E. Deisher). Micheal
may also have DOSEMU added to the Debian distribution down the road.

and:
tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/dosemu0.50.tgz

And hopefuly soon at :
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Emulators/dosemu0.50.tgz
when I get to ftp there :-).

Updated in this release:

  As always, many, thanks to all who have helped with this release, 
either by sending in bug reports so we knew something was wrong, by 
sending in bug fixes (which may not have made it into this release), 
or by just providing a sounding board for ideas that come up.
  My apologies for not having answered every letter, and possibly 
missing some of the important information. If you know something you
think we should, try to contact me again, please.

Later,
JES
