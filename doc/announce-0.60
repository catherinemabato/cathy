ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 0.60.4, the PC Emulator for Linux.
Please remember to consider this as ALPHA software.


WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine.  This allows you to run
many DOS applications.  These are capabilities of DOSEMU worth noting:

  - Color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) via terminal
  - Built-in X-Windows support, includes IBM character set font!
  - Graphics capability at the console with most compatible video cards.
  - Much-improved DPMI support.
  - Runs Borland BCC.EXE / TCC.EXE version 3.x command line compilers!
  - Borlandc C++ 3.x IDE (with emumodule.o or kernel patch)
  - Runs several 32-bit DPMI-compilant video games, including DOS/4GW,
     at the Linux console.  A partial list of successfully tested games
     includes DOOM2, Heretic, Descent, MK2, OMF2097, ROTT, and WarCraft!
  - NetBSD verison of DOSEMU appreciating a growing success, 
     contact jtk@atria.com
  - CDROM support
  - NetWare and other network connectivity via builtin IPX and pktdrvr
     support.



REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Linux 1.1.45+ (with IPC support, IPX support optional)
  - GCC 2.5.8+ and LIBC 4.5.21+ are recommended for best results.
  - Plenty of swap, since DOSEMU requires between 12 and 25 megabytes
     of total memory to compile, depending on Makefile configuration.

WHERE TO GET IT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU PC Emulator can be downloaded from the following FTP sites
when version 0.60.4:

  tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/dosemu0.60.4.tgz
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Emulators/dosemu0.60.4.tgz


TO BE NOTED:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This release will be considered as the stepping stone for the team
to finally cut off using the old developement directory structure and
begin working towards a new and hopefully improved layout. This will
likely be noticed by us being away from civilization as work progresses
to the new format. Please have patience for approximately the next
month.
