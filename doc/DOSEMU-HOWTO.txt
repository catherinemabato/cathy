  The dosemu HOWTO
  edited by Mike Deisher, deisher@dspsun.eas.asu.edu
  v0.60.1, 10 Mar 1995

  This is the `Frequently Asked Questions' (FAQ) / HOWTO document for
  dosemu.  The most up-to-date version of the dosemu-HOWTO may be found
  in dspsun.eas.asu.edu:/pub/dosemu.

  1.  The preliminaries

  1.1.  What is dosemu, anyway?

  To quote the manual, "dosemu is a user-level program which uses
  certain special features of the Linux kernel and the 80386 processor
  to run MS-DOS in what we in the biz call a `DOS box.'  The DOS box, a
  combination of hardware and software trickery, has these capabilities:

  o the ability to virtualize all input/output and processor control
  instructions

  o the ability to support the word size and addressing modes of the
  iAPX86 processor family's "real mode," while still running within the
  full protected mode environment

  o the ability to trap all DOS and BIOS system calls and emulate such
  calls as are necessary for proper operation and good performance

  o the ability to simulate a hardware environment over which DOS
  programs are accustomed to having control.

  o the ability to provide MS-DOS services through native Linux
  services; for example, dosemu can provide a virtual hard disk drive
  which is actually a Linux directory hierarchy."


  1.2.  What's the newest version of dosemu and where can I get it?

  The newest version of dosemu is dosemu0.60 and can be ftp'ed from the
  following sites:

       dspsun.eas.asu.edu:/pub/dosemu/
       tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/



  However, pre-release versions are also available for developers and
  ALPHA testers.  They may be found in

       dspsun.eas.asu.edu:/pub/dosemu/Development/
       tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/Development


  and have names of the form pre0.61_??.  The pre-release code has the
  advantage that it is compatible with the most recent Linux kernels.
  Also, it includes new features.  Remember that this is ALPHA code,
  however: there may be serious bugs and very little documentation for
  new features.


  1.3.  Where can I follow the development?

  If you want to follow the development of dosemu, you should consider
  subscribing to the linux-msdos-digest mailing list.  To subscribe,
  send mail to Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the following command in
  the body of your email message:

      subscribe linux-msdos-digest your_username@your.email.address


  If you ever want to remove yourself from the mailing list, you can
  send mail to Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the following command in
  the body of your email message:

      unsubscribe linux-msdos-digest your_username@your.email.address




  1.4.  What documentation is available for dosemu?

  The dosemu manual (dosemu.texinfo) written by Robert Sanders has not
  been updated in some time but is still a good source of information.
  It is distributed with dosemu.

  The "dosemu Novice's Altering Guide" or DANG is a road map to the
  inner workings of dosemu.  It is designed for the adventurous, those
  who wish to modify the source code themselves.  The DANG is maintained
  by Alistair MacDonald (am20@unix.york.ac.uk) and is posted once in a
  while to the MSDOS channel of Linux Activists.

  The EMU success list (EMUsuccess.txt) is a list of all programs that
  have been reported to work with dosemu.  It is posted once in a while
  to the mailing list.  The most recent version can be found on
  dspsun.eas.asu.edu:/pub/dosemu.

  And then, of course, there is the dosemu FAQ/HOWTO.  But you already
  know about that, don't you.  It is also posted once in a while to the
  mailing list.  The most recent version can be found on
  dspsun.eas.asu.edu:/pub/dosemu.


  1.5.  How do I submit changes or additions to the HOWTO?

  The preferred method is to edit the file, dosemu-HOWTO-xx.x.sgml to
  incorporate the changes, create a diff file by typing something like


                 diff original-file new-file



  and send it to deisher@dspsun.eas.asu.edu.  If you do not know SGML,
  that's ok.  Changes or new information in any form will be accepted.
  Creating the diff file just makes it easier on the HOWTO maintainer.

  2.  Compiling and installing dosemu

  2.1.  Where are the installation instructions?

  The installation instructions are in the file, "QuickStart", included
  in the distribution.


  2.2.  Top ten problems while compiling and installing dosemu.

  (4/8/95)

  1. Forgetting to read the QuickStart Guide.

  2. Try to compile with a kernel older than 1.1.45.

  3. Having the wrong linux kernel source sitting in /usr/src/linux

  4. Use dosemu with a kernel that does not have IPC compiled in.

  5. Compile with gcc older than 2.5.8 or libc older than 4.5.21.

  6. Forget to edit your /etc/dosemu.conf file.

  7. Forget to run "FDISK /mbr" on your hdimage.

  8. Run DOSEMU with partition access while they are already mounted.

  9. Don't install dosemu with sufficient priveledges (i.e., root).

  10. Try to run DOSEMU on a multi-user linux Internet Service Provider.



  2.3.  How can I build a single (non-library) executable?

  Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (4/8/95) that

  If you want to build one executable with QMAGIC, define STATIC in the
  makefile.  Otherwise there's a library/executable combination.


  2.4.  How do I make ELF binaries?

  Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (4/8/95) that

  If you want to make ELF binaries, define ELF in the "Makefile".  You
  need to make and install the slang library separately.  Slang works
  well as a shared ELF library.


  2.5.  How do I compile dosemu on a machine with low memory?

  Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (4/8/95) that

  If you have problems with running out of swap space you may want to
  add CFLAGS+=-fno-inline after CFLAGS is defined in dpmi/Makefile.  Be
  careful before you do this and check for the existence of swap space.
  I found Linux crashes a times when it has no swap space.


  2.6.  How can I speed up compilation?

  Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (4/8/95) that

  The default optimization is -O2.  You may want edit the makefile to
  use -O (compiled somewhat faster/smaller).


  2.7.  How can I compile non-interactively?

  Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (4/8/95) that

  If you define do_DEBUG in the makefile, you'll get -Wall -g and a non-
  tex, non-interactive make.


  2.8.  More compilation tips from Marty...

  Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (4/8/95) that

  You need to have build the kernel on your system to get the current
  version.  If not, you may want to hand modify KERNEL_VERSION in the
  top level Makefile.  The number is of the form, "nmmmppp", where "n"
  is the version, "mmm" is the minor version, and "ppp" is the
  patchlevel.  For example, kernel 1.1.88 corresponds to "1001088" and
  kernel 1.2.1 to "1002001".

  Begin all makes at the top level for best results.  At the top level,
  entering "make subdirectory" will make the subdirectory.  Each
  directory (and the top), has targets "clean" and "realclean".  "clean"
  will remove the objects, "realclean will also remove dependencies and
  other files.


  2.9.  Do I need to compile dosemu as root?

  (4/8/95)

  No.  You must install it as root, though.


  Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) adds

  In order to access I/O ports (including the console) dosemu needs to
  run as root.  Running dosemu on an xterm or in X windows and requiring
  now direct hardware access allows you to run dosemu as a user.  The
  security/setuid implications will be worked on in development
  releases.



  3.  Hard disk setup

  3.1.  How do I use my hard disk with dosemu?

  First, mount your dos hard disk partition as a Linux subdirectory.
  For example, you could create a directory in Linux such as /dos (mkdir
  -m 755 /dos) and add a line like


     /dev/hda1       /dos     msdos   umask=022


  to your /etc/fstab.  (In this example, the hard disk is mounted read-
  only.  You may want to mount it read/write by replacing "022" with
  "000" and using the -m 777 option with mkdir).  Now mount /dos.  Now
  you can add a line like

    lredir d: linux\fs/dos


  to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in your hdimage (see the comments on LREDIR
  below).  On a multi-user system you may want to use

    lredir d: linux\fs\${home}


  where "home" is the name of an environmental variable that contains
  the location of the dos directory (/dos in this example).

  ---------------------


  Tim Bird (Tim_R_Bird@Novell.COM) states that LREDIR users should

  be careful when they use LREDIR in the autoexec, because COMMAND.COM
  will continue parsing the autoexec.bat from the redirected drive as
  the same file offset where it left off in the autoexec.bat on the
  physical drive.  For this reason, it is safest to have the
  autoexec.bat on the redirected drive and the physical drive
  (diskimage) be the same.

  ---------------------


  Robert D. Warren (rw11258@xx.acs.appstate.edu) reported (4/28/94) that

  I boot off a small hdimage file (less than 1 MB - and twice as large
  as needs be at that), and the next to last line in my config.sys file
  on the hdimage boot image is:


          install=c:\lredir.exe LINUX\FS\home/dos


  This will execute lredir just before the command interpreter runs. And
  I have successfully run it with both command.com and 4DOS.  This elim-
  inates the offset problem using lredir in autoexec.bat.


  3.2.  Can I use my stacked/double-spaced/super-stored disk?

  At this time, compressed drives cannot be accessed via the redirector
  (lredir or emufs).  However, many people have had success by simply
  uncommenting the

     disk { wholedisk "/dev/hda" }        # 1st partition on 1st disk


  line in their dosemu config file.  Others have had success using

     disk { partition "/dev/hda1" }




  If your dos partition is already mounted with write access and you try
  to run dosemu with partition or whole disk access, dosemu will print a
  warning message and abort.  This prevents DOS and Linux from making
  independent writes to your disk and trashing the data on your dos
  partition.

  ---------------------

  If LILO is installed, the above will not work.  However...

  Thomas Mockridge (thomas@aztec.co.za) reported (8/5/94) that

  To boot dosemu with LILO and Stacker 4.0 I did a little work around...

  1. dd the MBR to a file. (or norton utility, etc., first 512 bytes)

  2. Boot dos (from full boot not emu), do a fdisk /mbr, make your dos
  partition active with (dos) fdisk.

  3. Copy the new MBR to a file.

  4. Replace the original MBR

  5. Copy the second MBR to /var/lib/dosemu/partition.hda? (Whichever is
  your dos partition)

  6. Set dosemu.conf

                 disk {partition "/dev/hda? ?"}



  7. Start dosemu and and voila!  No LILO.

  ---------------------

  Holger Schemel (q99492@pbhrzx.uni-paderborn.de) reported (2/10/94)
  that

  Works even fine under DOSEMU with MS-DOS 6.0. If you have problems,
  then you have to edit the file 'DBLSPACE.INI' manually and change the
  disk letter to the letter your drive gets under DOSEMU.

  ---------------------

  Darren J Moffat (moffatd@dcs.gla.ac.uk) also reported (3/27/94)

  "...use 6.2 if you can get it!!  Just make sure you have a lilo boot
  disk on hand since dos 6{.2} will change the MBR of the boot HD."


  4.  Parallel ports, serial ports and mice

  4.1.  Where are the (microsoft compatible) mouse drivers?

  Tom Kimball (tk@pssparc2.oc.com) reported (11/24/93) that

  Several people said to use a different mouse driver and suggested
  some.  I found a couple that seem to work fine.

     oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/mouse/mouse701.zip   (mscmouse)
     oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/mouse/gmous102.zip   (gmouse)




  4.2.  Why doesn't the mouse driver work?

  Mark Rejhon (mdrejhon@magi.com) reported (4/7/95) that

  If you start the mouse driver and it just hangs (it might actually
  take 30-60s), but if you are waiting longer than a minute for the
  mouse driver to start, try specifying the COM port that the mouse is
  on, at the mouse driver command line.


  4.3.  Why does dosemu clobber COM4?

  Rob Janssen (rob@pe1chl.ampr.org) reported (3/24/94) that

  According to jmorriso@bogomips.ee.ubc.ca, "dosemu still clobbers COM4
  (0x2e8, IRQ 5). 0x2e8 isn't in ports{} in config.  I have to run
  setserial /dev/cua3 irq 5 on it after dosemu exits."

  This is caused by your VGA BIOS.  I have found that by enabling the IO
  port trace and seeing where it was clobbered.

  Disable the "allowvideoportaccess on" line in config and it will work
  fine.  When you then have problems with the video, try to enable more
  selective ranges of IO addresses (e.g., 40-43).


  4.4.  How do I use dosemu over the serial ports?




  4.5.  How can I switch between dosemu and a shell over the serial
  line?

  John Taylor (taylor@pollux.cs.uga.edu) reported (5/25/94) that

  I am running Linux 1.1.13 and want to point out a great feature that
  should be protected and not taken out (IMHO). With the 52 version, I
  can run the program, "screen."  From screen, i can invoke dos -D-a.
  What is really great (IMHO) is the screen commands (the CTRL-A cmds)
  still work. This means I can do a CTRL-A C and add another unix shell,
  and switch between the two (DOS / UNIX).  This allows me to use dosemu
  over the serial line really well, because switching is made easy.


  4.6.  How can I get the parallel ports to work?

  Dennis Flaherty (dennisf@flaherty.elk.miles.com) reported (3/2/95)
  that

  The dosemu.conf has lines at the end to redirect printers to either
  lpr or a file.  If you want direct access to the bare metal, comment
  out these emulation lines, and add the line

  ports { 0x3b8 0x3b9 0x3ba 0x3bb 0x3bc 0x3bd 0x3be 0x3bf } # lpt0


  for the "monitor card" printer port (corresponds to /dev/lp0), or

  ports { 0x378 0x379 0x37a 0x37b 0x37c 0x37d 0x37e 0x37f } # lpt1
  ports { 0x278 0x279 0x27a 0x27b 0x27c 0x27d 0x27e 0x27f } # lpt2


  for LPT1 (/dev/lp1) and LPT2 (/dev/lp2) respectively.


  5.  Multiple users and Non-interactive sessions

  5.1.  Can I use dosemu on a multi-user system?

  Corey Sweeney (corey@amiganet.xnet.com) reported (12/8/93) that

  If you are running dosemu on a system in which more then one person
  may want to run dosemu, then you may want to change the directory of
  your hard drive image.  Currently in the /etc/dosemu.conf file there
  exists the line saying that the hard drive image is "hdimage".  If you
  change this to /var/lib/dosemu/hdimage then people do not have to
  worry about what directory they are in when they run dosemu, and
  hdimage does not have to be moved each time you upgrade to the next
  patch level.

  If you do do this for multi-user dosemu, then you will want to make
  the hdimage in /var/lib/dosemu read-only for everyone but the dosemu
  administrator.

  Note that you can use the new emufs.sys thing to mount a "public"
  directory and/or a "private" directory (a sub-directory in each
  person's home directory).


  [Note: Users may also create a personal configuration file named
  ~/.dosrc (same format as /etc/dosemu.conf) to run their own copy of
  dos.]


  5.2.  How can I run dos commands non-interactively?

  I have been meaning to write an article on this for quite some time
  but have not gotten around to it.  Here are some hints from others:


  Dan Newcombe (newcombe@aa.csc.peachnet.edu) reported (1/27/94) that

  Here is an idea (untested) to be able to run a DOS command from the
  command line (or menu choice, etc...) without modifying the acutal
  emulator.  [Your dos partition is assumed to be mounted under Linux,
  already.]

  Suppose you wanted to run wp60.exe with the parameter "wp60
  d:\doc\paper.txt".  You would do something like "dosrun wp60
  d:\doc\paper.txt".  "dosrun" would be a linux shell program that would
  a) edit/modify/recreate the dos autoexec.bat from your dos partition
  and b) simply run dosemu (e.g., "dos -C >/dev/null".  Step a) would
  somehow keep all the stuff you'd normally want in autoexec.bat (e.g.,
  mouse.com) and the last line would be "wp60 d:\doc\paper.txt".

  On the dosemu side, beforehand, you would have to modify the
  config.sys file (located in hdimage) so that it 1) uses emufs to
  access the dos partition as D:, 2) sets "COMPSEC=D:\ (I think.  I
  don't have a DOS manual around.), and 3) sets "shell=c:\command.com
  /p".

  The idea is that for each time that you load the DOS emulator, you
  will recreate an autoexec.bat that is specific to that session.  What
  makes it specific is that the last line will execute the program you
  want.  The modifications on the hdimage are to tell the emulator/DOS
  that you want to use (and effectivly) boot off of D:, which will be
  the actual DOS partition.

  If you do not use hdimage and access the DOS filesystem directly upon
  boot-up of DOSEMU, then this will work, and you don't have to go
  through the hdimage part of this all.
  ---------------------


  Daniel T. Schwager (danny@dragon.s.bawue.de) reported (7/2/94) that

  You can use different dosemuf.conf files (and different hd-boot-images
  with different autoexec.bat's) and call dosemu like

  $ dos -F my_quicken_q_exe_dosemu.conf



  ---------------------


  Dietmar Braun (braun@math20.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de) reported
  (7/4/94) that

  This is no problem at all when you use the redirector of dosemu.  It
  is possible to redirect a drive letter to a linux path given by an
  environment variable.

  So I have a shell script named "DOS" which does something like

   mkdir /tmp/dos.\*(dR\*(dR
   DOSTMP=/tmp/dos.\*(dR\*(dR; export DOSTMP


  and then a little trick to get "echo $* > $DOSTMP/startup.bat" really
  working (actually a small C Program which turns '/' in '\' and termi-
  nates lines correctly for messy dos with cr/lf pairs and adds ^Z at
  the end of the file), creates startup files, links and so on in this
  directory, and then starts dosemu. Within "autoexec.bat" drive c: is
  redirected from hdimage to this tmp-directory, which has links for
  $HOME and $PWD.

  So if I want to see my filenames shortened to 8.3 I can type "DOS dir"
  and I get my current directory listing.  So I have full DOS multi user
  (I don't have any DOS partition and redirecting to Linux preserves
  user permissions) and multi tasking. (dosemu sessions are completely
  independent).  I did this once to be able to use a dos driver for my
  printer. My printcap df is actually a DOS program. So you can even
  make DOS executables act as lpr filters.


  6.  dosemu and Netware

  6.1.  How do I get Netware access from dosemu?

  James B. MacLean (jmaclean@fox.nstn.ns.ca) reported (11/28/94) that

  Dosemu now supports  pdipx  (an IPX over pktdrvr)  and  pdether  (uses
  Novell's  MLID spec)  to  access  Novell LAN's via the built in packet
  driver.   The  packet  driver sits at interrupt 0x60, and abids by the
  normal paket driver rules.  That said, beware of trying any DOS TCP/IP
  just yet.  Single access can be made by:

  1) cd ./net
  2) cp libpacket.c.single libpacket.c
  3) cp pktnew.c.single pktnew.c
  4) recompile DOSEMU
  5) run dosemu
  6) load pdether as described by its docs (pdipx is another method)
  7) load netx
  8) enjoy netware access :-)

  If you  need  special  access  to  your  NIC,  read  on.   By  default
  dosemu  will  not  get interrupts from the kernel. That said, if you'd
  like to give your NIC to dosemu for it to control, maybe for access to
  Netware  on  the  network  through  a  NETX client, I do have a driver
  (Silly Interrupt Generator) to put in the  kernel  that  any  program,
  like dosemu can use to get at the interrupt for your NIC.  I use it in
  DOSEMU to access a Novell Lite network in the  past  until  the packet
  driver existed.

  Any interested parties should E-mail me (jmaclean@fox.nstn.ns.ca) and
  I'll pass along some directions.

  Want multiple DOSEMU's access to Novell?

  1) compile current [pre-release] DOSEMU
  2) follow directions in ./v-net/dosnet.README
  3) carry on from 5) above.




  6.2.  Netware HOWTO

  (4/8/95)

  The Netware-HOWTO by Lauri Tischler (ltischler@fipower.pp.fi) is now a
  separate document.  It is included with the dosemu distribution and
  may also be found at your favorite HOWTO sites (e.g.,
  http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/linux.html).


  7.  dosemu and X-windows

  7.1.  Can I run dosemu in console mode while running X?

  Ronald Schalk (R.Schalk@uci.kun.nl) reported (1/17/94) that

  Yes, no problem.  Just remember to use ctrl-alt-<Fn> to go to a
  Virtual Console (VC), and you can run any Linux application (dosemu is
  a linux-application).  I've got almost always WP5.1 in a dos session.

  [Note:  Use ctrl-alt-F7 to switch back to X from dosemu.]



  7.2.  Is it possible to run dosemu in an xterm?

  Yes, but the proper way to do this is to start up dosemu with either
  dos -X or xdos.  Before you do, make sure you have:

















  1. made sure dosemu has X support compiled in (X_SUPPORT=1 in the Makefile).

  2. installed <tt/ansi_xterm/.  It is on <tt/tsx-11/ if you need it.

  3. installed the VGA font.  You can do this by:

      cd /usr/src/dosemu-0.60 ; sh xinstallvgafont

  4. set up your X key-mappings.  In an xterm, type

     xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = 0xff08"
     xmodmap -e "keycode 107 = 0xffff"

     The first line fixes your backspace key and the second line fixes
     your delete key.

  5. set the X-related configuration options in your <tt/dosemu.conf/
     file.




  Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (3/31/95) that

  I have xrdb log the following resources

  dosxterm*Font:  vga
  dosxterm*geometry:      80x25
  dosxterm*saveLines: 25


  or I alias "dosxterm" to "term -fn vga -title dosxterm -geometry 80x25
  -sl 25"

  If you use the xrdb method, all you have to do is run "xterm -name
  dosxterm"


  7.3.  Does ansi emulation work properly?

  Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (3/31/95) that

  Yes.  I use nnansi.com under X windows.  I find 25, 43 and 50 line
  mode work properly, however 50 line mode is difficult to use on a
  1024x768 screen (unless smaller fonts are used are you use a bigger
  screen.  43 line mode will resize the xterm window to use 43 lines.



  8.  dosemu and MS-Windows 3.1

  8.1.  Is it possible to run MS-Windows 3.1 under dosemu?

  The README file says:

  What, you're still reading?  Okay, it is possible to boot WINOS2 (the
  modified version of Windows 3.1 that OS/2 uses) under DOSEMU.  Many
  kudos to Lutz and Dong!

  There are many known problems.  Windows is prone to crash and could
  take data with it.  Large programs will not load.  The mouse may be
  painfully sluggish, etc., etc., etc.  In other words, it is NOT ready
  for daily use.  Many video cards are known to have problems (you may
  see a nice white screen.)  Your program groups are all likely to
  disappear.  Basically, it's a pain.

  On the other hand, if you're dying to see the little Windows screen
  running under Linux and you have read this CAREFULLY and PROMISE NOT
  TO BOMBARD THE DOSEMU DEVELOPERS WITH "MS Word 6.0 doesn't run!!!"
  MESSAGES...


  1.  Get DOSEMU & the Linux source distributions.
  2.  Unpack DOSEMU.
  3.  Patch the linux kernel with the file kernel.diff in the DOSEMU ./dpmi
      directory.
  4.  Recompile the kernel.
  5.  Compile DOSEMU.
  6.  Reboot the kernel.
  7.  Get the WINOS2.ZIP distribution from tsx-11.mit.edu
  8.  Unpack the WINOS2 files into your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
  9.  Reboot linux, and startup dosemu (make certain that DPMI is "ON")
  10. Copy the file winemu.bat to your c: drive.
  11. Cross your fingers.



  Good luck!


  REMEMBER:  THIS IS NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED!!!  THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED!!!
             WE DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU TRY THIS!!!




  9.  Video and sound

  9.1.  Exiting from dosemu gives me a screen full of garbage.

  (4/8/95)

  The problem is that the font information for the vga text screen is
  not being saved.  Get a copy of the svgalib package.  The current
  source is in

  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/svgalib125.tar.gz

  It may also be available as a pre-compiled package in your favorite
  Linux distribution (e.g., Slackware, etc.).  Use savetextmode to save
  the current text mode and font to a file in /tmp before running
  dosemu.  Then run textmode upon exiting dosemu to restore it.


  9.2.  How do I get dosemu to work with my Trident/Actix/other video
  card?

  [The screen flickers violently, displays the video BIOS startup
  message, and hangs.]

  Andrew Tridgell (tridge@nimbus.anu.edu.au) reported (1/29/94) that

  I found with early versions it would work if I used:

     ports { 0x42 }


  but that sometimes my machine would crash when it was cycling the
  video bios in dosemu. This is because you're allowing the VGA bios to
  re-program your clock, which severely stuffs with Linux.

  This prompted me to write the readonly and masking patches for dosemu,
  which I believe are still in the latest version. I now use:

     ports { readonly 0x42 }


  and it boots dosemu more slowly, but more reliably.

  ---------------------

  Tim Shnaider (tims@kcbbs.gen.nz) also reported (1/18/94) that

  One way of fixing this is to use the GETROM program to dump your video
  bios to a file and edit the config file in the /etc/dosemu directory
  There will be a few video lines.  Here is my video line

     video { vga console graphics chipset trident memsize 1024 vbios_file
     /etc/dosemu/vbios }


  where vbios is the file generated by typing

     getrom > vbios



  ---------------------


  Douglas Gleichman (p86884@tcville.edsg.hac.com) reported (9/1/94) that
  (with the ATI Graphics Ultra)

  For DOSEMU 0.52 you need to add this line to your dosemu.conf file:

   ports  { 0x1ce 0x1cf 0x238 0x23b 0x23c 0x23f 0x9ae8 0x9ae9 0x9aee 0x9aef }


  The board self test will list a failure but graphics programs will run
  fine.




  9.3.  Why doesn't my soundcard software work with dosemu?

  Hannu Savolainen (hsavolai@cs.Helsinki.FI) reported (3/21/94) that

  The DOSEMU and any DOS program with it run under control of a
  protected mode operating system. This means that the memory is not
  mapped as the program expects. If it somehow manages to start DMA
  based recording with SB, the recorded sound doesn't find it's way to
  the application. It just destroys some data in the memory.


  James B. MacLean (jmaclean@fox.nstn.ns.ca) reported (6/19/94) that

  Sorry to disappoint, but at this time DOSEMU does not support directly
  the necessary interception of interrupts or DMA generally required for
  sound card access via DOSEMU :-(.

  It's bound to happen at some future date though :-),


  9.4.  Dosemu crashed and now I can't type anything.

  Daniel Barlow(jo95004@sable.ox.ac.uk) reported (4/8/95) that

  If you have no terminal or network access that you can use to log in,
  you may have to press the reset button.  If you can still get a usable
  shell somehow, run "kbd_mode -a" to switch the keyboard out of raw
  mode, and/or "stty sane" on the console so that you can see what
  you're typing.


  10.  Other Hardware

  10.1.  How do I get my xxxxx device working under dosemu?

  Corey Sweeney (corey@bbs.xnet.com) reported (5/30/94) that

  Here is a log of my adventures trying to get devices working under
  dosemu.  So far I've gotten my voice mail system working and my
  scanner half working.  Here's how:

  1. Look in your manual and find if your card uses any ports.  If your
  manual gives you some, put them in your config file at the "ports"
  line.  Remember that sometimes you need to have several ports in a
  row, and the first one might be the only one documented.

  2. Try it out. If it doesn't work, or you don't have a manual (or your
  manual is as crappy as my AT&T manual:) then run dosemu with "dos -D+i
  2> /tmp/io.debug".  Run your device software, then exit dosemu.  Look
  through /tmp/io.debug and find any port numbers it might give you.
  Try adding those to the port lines and try running dosemu again.

  3. If you still fail then you may need interrupts.  Find out what
  interrupt the card uses and get the SIG.tgz (silly interrupt
  generator) from somewhere on tsx-11.mit.edu.  Install it as specified
  in the instructions.

  and that's about it...

  Question: What if my card uses DMA?  Answer: Your screwed.


  11.  Problems and fixes



  11.1.  What can I do?  I've crashed dosemu and left my keyboard in an
  unusable state.

  Jeff "Obik" Epler (jepler@herbie.unl.edu) reported (3/7/95) that

  you could run 'dosemu ; kbd_mode -a', so that after dosemu exits your
  keyboard is set back to ascii mode.


  11.2.  I've enabled EMS memory in dosemu.conf but it does not help.

  Rob Janssen (rob@pe1chl.ampr.org) reported (7/11/94)

  Don't forget to load the provided ems.sys from the config.sys file.


  11.3.  How do I get rid of all those annoying "disk change" messages?

  (8/11/94)

  Grab and install klogd.  Try

           sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Daemons/sysklogd1.2.tgz




  11.4.  Why won't dosemu run a second time after exiting in console
  mode?

  Aldy Hernandez (aldy@sauron.cc.andrews.edu) reported (7/8/94) that

  You should disable your video and/or bios caching.


  11.5.  Why will dosemu run in a term but not in the console?

  JyiJiin Luo (jjluo@casbah.acns.nwu.edu) reported (4/19/94) that

  I experienced exactly the same problem before. I figured out all the
  video shadow in my AMI BIOS must be disabled. Now dosemu runs fine on
  my system.


  11.6.  How can I speed up dosemu?

  In some cases it is useful to play with the value of the HogThreshold
  variable in your dosemu.conf file.


  Daniel Barlow(jo95004@sable.ox.ac.uk) reported (4/8/95) that

  HogThreshold should now be set to approximately half of the BogoMips
  value that the system reports on boot.



  11.7.  My CDROM drive has problems reading some files under dosemu.

  Vinod G Kulkarni (vinod@cse.iitb.ernet.in) reported (4/7/94) that

  When a CDROM is mounted from linux and used from within DOSEMU (mapped
  drive), there could be some problems. The cdrom driver (iso9660) in
  the kernel tries to find out the type of the file (i.e. binary or
  text).  If it can't find, it tries to guess the type of the file using
  a heuristic. This heuristic fails under some circumstances when a
  (almost) text file is to be treated as binary.  (I do not know if it
  is a bug or feature.)

  The result of this is that if you copy such a file from cdrom (from
  linux itself, and not necessarily dosemu), the resulting file will be
  usually bigger than original file. (Blanks get added before ^J,^M.)
  So a program running in dosemu gives an error or hangs, which may be
  mistaken as problem of dosemu.


  Rob Janssen (pe1chl@rabo.nl) reported (8/10/94) that

  The way to solve this is to turn off conversion altogether.  Pass the
  option "-o conv=binary" to the mount command mounting the CDROM, or
  use the following in /etc/fstab:

  /dev/cdrom      /cdrom          iso9660 conv=binary,ro


  No patches to the kernel are necessary.


  11.8.  How do I see debugging output?

  Daniel Barlow(jo95004@sable.ox.ac.uk) reported (4/8/95) that

  As of dosemu 0.60, debugging output is redirected to a file specified
  on the command line.  Use "dos -D+a -o /tmp/debug" to log all debug
  output to /tmp/debug.  There should no longer be any need to redirect
  stderr.



  11.9.  Why are my keystrokes echoed ttwwiiccee??

  Nick Holloway (alfie@dcs.warwick.ac.uk) reported (2/22/94) that

  After running dos after playing with some stty settings, I was getting
  doubled key presses.  I can now reveal what the reason is!

  It only happens when dos is run on the console with 'istrip' set.
  This is (I think) because the raw scancodes are mutilated by the
  'istrip', so that key release events look like key press events.

  So, the input processing needs to be turned off when using the scan
  codes on a console (it wouldn't be a good idea to do it for tty
  lines).


  12.  Contributing to the dosemu project

  12.1.  Who is responsible for dosemu?

  (3/18/94)

  Dosemu is built upon the work of Matthias Lautner and Robert Sanders.
  James B. MacLean (jmaclean@fox.nstn.ns.ca) is responsible for
  organizing the latest releases of dosemu.
