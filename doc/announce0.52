Here comes the great, new, faster, improved DOSEMU....Version 0.52!  

    DOSEMU is a Linux specific application that allows Linux to run many
DOS based programs. It requires a bootable DOS disk and Linux 1.1.12+
(with SYSV IPC support compiled in).  It will work with older 1.0.8+ 
kernels after recompiling your kernel with kernel patches included
with the DOSEMU package.

    This release could not have gotten out the door without the work of
the our relentless development team and friends, currently consisting
of at least:

Corey Sweeney, Jason Gorden, Tim Bird, Rob Jenneson, Jon Tombs,
Aaron, Alan Hourihane, Ronnie, Karl Kiniger, Michael Deisher, 
Daniel R. Barrlow, Scott Buchholz, Christoph Niemann, Mark Rejhon,
Theadore Tso, Lutz Molgedey, Larry Stephen, Derek Fawcus, Jochen Hein,
Alistair MacDonald, Linus Torvalds, Alan Cox, Bob Amstadt, 
Alessandro Rubini and possibly myself from time to time.

    Definitely still consider this ALPHA software, and as such please
beware it is not yet fully functional, or always smooth sailing.

Very soon, (As of June 16) it should be locatable at:
  tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/dosemu0.52.tgz
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Emulators/dosemu0.52.tgz
  dspsun.eas.asu.edu:/pub/dosemu/dosemu0.52.tgz

    Thanks to deisher@enws125.EAS.ASU.EDU (Michael E. Deisher) for dspsun.
Micheal may also have DOSEMU added to the Debian distribution down the 
road, now that DOSEMU 0.52 almost conforms to the Debian distribution
format.

*** NOTE ***
    There has been many changes since DOSEMU 0.50pl1, so please go to 
great caution to read the "QuickStart" file included with DOSEMU since 
the location and format of files (including the configuration file) has 
changed since the last public DOSEMU release.  One of the noteable
changes is /etc/dosemu now becomes /var/lib/dosemu.

Updated in this release:
     -  Major speed improvement (2-5 times faster) compared to DOSEMU 0.50.
	 Many thanks to Linus for the kernel enhancement, and always helpful
	 feedback.
     -  EMS 4.0 support is now near-complete.
     -  Optional EMS speedup with a kernel patch to map memory in user
	 space with /proc/self/mem. Thanks Scott for bringing Roberts
	 code up to date and testing it.
     -  Support for Novell Netware and other things are now via a
	built in packet driver at int 0x60. Rob Janssen has been busy.
     -  Improved foreign keyboard support.
     -  Improved DPMI support, although far from complete.  Someday, 
         maybe this fall, programs like Borland C++ or Maple V will work.
	 Some RSX extender based programs like emtex386 are allready runing.
     -  Improved serial support for modems.  More flexible with up to 4
         ports, thanks to mdrejhon@csclub.uwaterloo.ca (Mark Rejhon)
     -  Mice work a bit better, too, although not all drivers work.
     -  Busmice support well underway thanks to Alan Hourihane.
     -  S3 video code updated by niemann@swt.ruhr-uni-bochum.de 
         (Christoph Niemann)
     -  Real time clocks will become more accurate in the future, thanks to
         preparation of new code.  Should make some video games run faster.
	 Many Thanks to Jochen Hein for his continous efforts to clean up
	 what the rest of us leave behind.
     -  Easier Debug reports for you to send :-).
     -  More updates by Tim Bird to his internal IPX code.
     -  Major reorganization and cleanup. Way to go Jochen :-)
     -  Termcap updates are much faster in Xterms now, thanks to Mark Rejhon.

    As always, many, thanks to all who have helped with this release, 
either by sending in bug reports so we knew something was wrong, by 
sending in bug fixes (which may not have made it into this release), 
or by just providing a sounding board for ideas that come up.
    My apologies for not having answered every letter, and possibly 
missing some of the important information. If you know something you
think we should, try to contact me again, PLEASE.

Later,
JES
