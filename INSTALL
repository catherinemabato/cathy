building and installing dosemu2 from sources
==============================================

-> REQUIREMENTS for dosemu2:
    - fdpp of the latest version, for now from git or from PPA:
      https://code.launchpad.net/~dosemu2/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
      of from COPR:
      https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/stsp/dosemu2/
    - gcc >= 3.3 or clang >= 3.7.0
    - glibc >= 2.20
    - linux >= 3.16 for x86-64, >= 4.7 recommended.
      With older version than 3.16 there may be some problems
      with DPMI, especially make sure to not use 3.14 and 3.15.
      linux >= 4.3 for i386.
      linux >= 4.11 if you want to run 32bit dosemu under x86_64 kernel
      with multilib environment (you likely don't want to do this).
    - x86 (i386/x86-64) target CPU
    - bison and flex
    - SDL >= 2.0.6, >= 2.0.15 is recommended (older versions may not have
      scaling filters and KMS rendering working).
    - udev >= 240 recommended for KVM (execution acceleration)
    - libslirp >= 4.1.0 recommended for networking
    - json-c >= 0.13 recommended
    - development libraries: Xext, slang, gpm, alsa, fluidsynth,
      ladspa, libao can be used when available.

This means that Ubuntu Focal or Fedora 31 are the minimum
recommended systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Compile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you should run:

./autogen.sh

Then either:

./default-configure
make

or

- create a seperate directory and run
    $SRCDIR/configure (or $SRCDIR/default-configure; see below)
    make
  in that directory.

- If you want dosemu2 executable with debug info, then add -d parameter
  to default-configure on the previous step. But expect the debug build
  to work considerably slower than the release build!

- sudo make install

You can now start dosemu2 by typing "dosemu". But if you didn't install
comcom32, dosemu2 may not find command.com. We recommend to install
the pre-compiled comcom32 package either from PPA or COPR. Or you can
instead download it from here:
https://dosemu2.github.io/comcom32/files/comcom32.zip
unzip to ~/.dosemu/drive_c and symlink as command.com.
You may not want to build comcom32 from sources unless you know how
to install djgpp.
