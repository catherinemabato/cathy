<p>One of the long term aims of the DOSEMU development team is to provide
a client-server based system. This will allow people to add different 
display systems in more simply. Those in current development are detailed
in this section.</p>

<h2>2.1 <A Name="ss2.1"> clients/ncurses.c Information </h2>

<p>This is James' client based around NCURSES. It (un-)succesfully
demonstrates the procedure for making initial connections to the
server.</p>

<h3> Functions in clients/ncurses.c </h3>

<p>These are the functions defined in clients/ncurses.c.</p>

<p>main</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> argc - Number of Command Line arguments.</li>
<li> argv - Command Line arguments - as an array of char*'s</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>This function does all of the work associated with this client. It
grabs the shared memory used to hold the current Video data and makes some
comments about its current screen.</p>
