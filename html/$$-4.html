<p>All of the Video handling code is in the " video"  subdirectory.</p>
<p>There is one file for each video card or chipset and the master file. To
Add a new card, it needs a set of save &amp;  restore routines putting in a file
here.</p>

<h2>4.1 <A Name="ss4.1"> video/video.c Information </h2>

<p>All of the emulated video interrupts are here (ie int10). In addition,
all the code to try and properly save &amp;  restore the video state between
VC's and the attempts to control updates to the VC whilst the user is
using another. We map between the real screen address and that used by
DOSEMU here too.</p>
<p>Attempts to use a cards own bios require the addition of the parameter
'graphics' to the video statement in " /etc/dosemu.conf" . This will make
the emulator try to execute the card's initialization routine which is
normally located at address c000:0003. This can now be changed as an
option.</p>
