<h1>5 <a name="s5"> The Misc group of Modules </h1>
<p> <a href="$$.html#toc5"> Contents of this section</a></p>

<p>These are the remaining important files, that do not really fit into another
group. These should not be dismissed as unimportant - rather, they are often
amongst the most important.</p>

<h2>5.1 <A Name="ss5.1"> bios_emm.c Information </h2>

<p>This provides the EMM Memory Management for DOSEMU. It was originally part
of the Mach Dos Emulator. </p>
<p>Recent work in this area has involved a patch to the Kernel. If this is used
and the DEFINE MMAP_EMS line used, a faster form of EMS memory support is
included, using the /proc filesystem.</p>
<p>In contrast to some of the comments (Yes, _I_ know the adage about that...)
we appear to be supporting EMS 4.0, not 3.2</p>

<h2>5.2 <A Name="ss5.2"> emu.c Information </h2>

<p>This is where we call of the initialisation code. Everything not covered
elsewhere is handled here (Such logic !) By this we mean the speakers,
the standard memory, cassettes etc.</p>
<p>More than that, I cannot tell you - Things have changed a lot since I
last got an update ... 8-(</p>

<h2>5.3 <A Name="ss5.3"> xms.c Information </h2>

<p>Currently the XMS 3.0 spec is covered in this file. XMS is fairly simple
as it onbly deals with allocating extended memory and then moving it 
around in specific calls. This spec also includes the allocation of UMB's,
so they are also included as part of this file. The amount of xms memory
returned to DOS programs via the XMS requests, or int15 fnc88 is set in
" /etc/dosemu.conf"  via the XMS paramter.</p>

<h2>5.4 <A Name="ss5.4"> termio.c Information </h2>

<p>This handles the keyboard.</p>
<p>Two keyboard modes are handled 'raw' and 'xlate'. 'Raw' works with
codes as sent out by the kernel and 'xlate' uses plain ASCII as used over
serial lines. The mapping for different languages &amp;  the two ALT-keys is
done here, but the definitions are elsewhere. Only the default (US)
keymap is stored here.</p>

<h2>5.5 <A Name="ss5.5"> keymaps.c Information </h2>

<p>These are definitions, giving which key is related to which scancode in
raw keyboard mode. Basically, the code of 'x' on a US keyboard may be that
of a 'Y' on a German keyboard. This way, all types of keyboard can be
represented under DOSEMU. Also, the right ALT-key is often a function
key in it's own right.</p>
