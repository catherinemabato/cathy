<p>The Following items are used to delimit the text used to create this file.
Whilst it is not necessary to know this, they are included because they may
be useful for searching, as they are (at least at the moment) reasonably 
unique.</p>
<p>DANG_BEGIN_MODULE / DANG_END_MODULE
This will bracket a description of the file (normally at the
start).</p>
<p>DANG_BEGIN_FUNCTION / DANG_END_FUNCTION
This brackets a description of functions (good this, isn't it!)
Not every function needs to be described in this way - just the
major ones.</p>
<p>DANG_BEGIN_REMARK / DANG_END_REMARK
This brackets descriptions of obscure items, like data structures
and architecture.</p>
<p>DANG_FIXTHIS
This is a one line item, indicating a an area requiring a fix, or
redesign.</p>
<p>DANG_BEGIN_NEWIDEA / DANG_END_NEWIDEA
New Ideas Start Here! As Ideas are proposed, that get added with 
their description, so that future generations can laugh at or
code the ideas ..... These bracket the idea description.</p>
<p>DANG_BEGIN_CHANGELOG / DANG_END_CHANGELOG
Changelogs - very useful for bug fixing, and avvailable for use
with DPR (or that's the theory)</p>
