I have put dosemu47.7.tar.Z onto tsx-11.mit.edu in the
/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu directory.

dosemu47.7.tar.Z is a collection of my enhanced sources to the MS-DOS
emulator originally written by Matthias Lautner.  Note that the term
MS-DOS "emulator" is a misnomer, as you must have a copy of MS-DOS to
boot it.  I doubt this is a problem for anybody.

Suggestions for less misleading names are welcome.

This version, dosemu 0.47.7, has not changed significantly from the
previous version, dosemu 0.47.  However, several configuration options
have been made easier, some small but annoying bugs have been fixed,
and the RAW keyboard (-k) mode has been made much safer.

Thanks to Andrew Haylett and Stephen Tweedie for bug fixes and enhancements.
Also, thanks to all you who are bravely risking your filesystems, your
machines, nay, your very lives, to help me test this thing.

Read README.first for details.  Read the Makefile for help on configuration.
