Simply run ./submit-bug-report and fill in as much information as you 
can about the bug. The system will automatically make copies of your
/etc/dosemu.conf and your .dosrc (if you have one). It also allows you
to include a file containing debug information.

category as this will help us to trace and deal with the bug quickly.

The default action is to save the report in a file which you can then
send later or from another machine. [1]
If you have a direct internet connection then the bug report can be sent
straight away if you set the 'Report Action' to 'email'.
</para>

bug report has been recieved and details of who is tracking the bug.

[1] You will probably need to edit the file before you can send it. 
Please try and preserve the headers as they are important. If you 
have access to another unix system then the best method for sending 
the file is to feed the file to '/usr/lib/sendmail -t'.
