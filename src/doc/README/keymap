<sect>Keymaps
<p>
		This keymap is for using dosemu over telnet, and
having *all* your keys work.  This keymap is not complete.  But
hopefully with everyones help it will be someday :)
<p>

		There are a couple of things that are intentionally
broken with this keymap, most noteably F11 and F12.  This is because
they are not working though slang correctly at the current instant.
I have them mapped to "greyplus" and "greyminus".  Also the scroll
lock is mapped to shift-f3.  This is because the scroll lock dosn't
work right at all.  Please feel free to send keymap patches in that
fix anything but these.
<p>
If you want to patch <em/dosemu/ to fix either of those problems, i'd be
<em/glad/ to accept those :)
<p>
to figure out how to edit this, read the keystroke-howto.
<p>
as of 3/30/95, control/shift/alternate
home/insert/delete/end/pageup/pagedown should work.  
<p>
Major issues will be:
<p>
Do we move "alt-&lt;fkey&gt;" to "control-&lt;fkey&gt;" to switch virtual
consoles?
<p>
who is going to fix the linux keyboard device to be able to handle
multiple keymaps at the same time?
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------
<p>
to use it:
<p>
as root type
<tscreen><verb>
	loadkeys dosemu.new.keymap
</verb></tscreen>

(then run dosemu via telnet, or something in slang mode)
<p>

when your done, find your old keymap, and load it back, cause
control-home won't work in emacs anymore (or any other special key in
any applicaion that uses xlate)
<p>


if you find a key missing, please add it and send me the patch.  (test
it first! :)
<p>
if you find a key missing, and don't feel like coding it, <em>don't tell
me</em>!  I already know that there are a lot of keys missing.
