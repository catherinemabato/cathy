<sect>The old way of generating a bootable DOSEmu
<p>
Since dosemu-0.66.4 you will not need the complicated method of generating
a bootable dosemu suite (see Quickstart). However, who knows, maybe you
need the old information too ...

<sect1> Boot ( 'traditional' method )
<p>

<sect2>If you are <em/new to DOSEMU/
<p>

<itemize>
<item> Make <em/CERTAIN/ that your first disk statement in /etc/dosemu.conf <em/IS/
  pointing to your hdimage!

<item> Reboot DOS (the real version, not DOSEMU.)  Put a newly formatted
  diskette in your a: drive.  Run "sys a:" to transfer the system files
  to the diskette.  Copy SYS.COM from your DOS directory
  (usually C:\DOS) to the diskette.

<item> Reboot Linux.  Run 'dos -A'.  After a short pause, the system should
  come up.  Try "dir c:" which should list the files on the harddrive
  distribution image.  If that works, run: "sys c:".
  Exit dos by running "c:\exitemu".  If you have problems, hold down the
  &lt;ctrl&gt; and &lt;alt&gt; buttons simultaneously while pressing &lt;pgdn&gt;.
  (&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;pgdn&gt; will automatically exit dosemu.)
</itemize>

<sect2>If you already have a HDIMAGE file
<p>

<itemize>
<item> If you have a previous version of DOSEMU running, you should copy the
  .SYS, .COM, & .EXE files in the ./commands directory over to the
  hdimage drive that you boot from.  Some of these files have changed.
</itemize>

<sect2>If you don't know how to copy files from/to the hdimage
<p>

<itemize>
<item> Have a look at the recent mtools package (version 3.6 at time of writeing).
  If you have the following line in /etc/mtools.conf

<tscreen><verb>
     drive g: file="/var/lib/dosemu/hdimage" partition=1 offset=128
</verb></tscreen>

  then you can use <em/all the mtool commands/ to access it, such as

<tscreen><verb>
    # mcopy g:autoexec.bat -
    Copying autoexec.bat
    @echo off
    echo "Welcome to dosemu 0.66!"
</verb></tscreen>

</itemize>

  ... all clear ? ;-)
