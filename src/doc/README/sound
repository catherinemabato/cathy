<sect>Sound

<p>
The SB code is currently in a state of flux. Some changes to the code have been
made which mean that I can separate the DSP handling from the rest of the SB
code, making the main case statements simpler. In the meantime, Rutger
Nijlunsing has provided a method for redirecting access to the MPU-401 chip
into the main OS. 

<sect1>Using the MPU-401 "Emulation".
<p>
The Sound driver opens "/var/run/dosemu-midi" and
writes the Raw MIDI data to this. A daemon is provided which can be can be used
to seletc the instruments required for use on some soundcards. It is also
possible to get various instruments by redirecting '/var/run/dosemu-midi' to
the relevant part of the sound driver eg:

<tscreen><verb>
% ln -s /dev/midi /var/run/dosemu-midi
</verb></tscreen>

This will send all output straight to the default midi device and use whatever
instruments happen to be loaded.

<sect1>The MIDI daemon
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
  make midid
</verb></tscreen>
<p>
This compiles and installs the midi daemon. The daemon currently has support
for the 'ultra' driver and partial support for the 'OSS' driver (as supplied
with the kernel) and for no midi system. Support for the 'ultra' driver will
be compiled in automatically if available on your system.
<p>
Copy the executable './bin/midid' so that it is on your path, or somewhere you
can run it easily.
<p>
Before you run DOSEmu for the first time, do the following:
<tscreen><verb>
  rm -f /var/run/dosemu-midi
  mknod /var/run/dosemu-midi p
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Then you can use the midi daemon like this:
<tscreen><verb>
  ./midid < /var/run/dosemu-midi &; dos
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
(Assuming that you put the midid executeable in the directory you run DOSEmu
from.) 

<sect1>Disabling the Emulation at Runtime
<p>
You can now disable the code after it is compiled in by setting the IRQ or DMA
channels to invalid values (ie IRQ = 0 or > 15, or DMA = 4 or > 7)
The simplest way, however, is to say 'sound_emu off' in /etc/dosemu.conf
