<sect1>PROGRAMMING INFORMATION
<p>
	Information on a 16550 is based on information from 
	HELPPC.EXE 2.1 and results from National Semiconductor's
	COMTEST.EXE diagnostics program.  This code aims to emulate 
	a 16550A as accurately as possible, using just reasonably 
	POSIX.2 compliant code.  In some cases, this code does a 
	better job than OS/2 serial emulation (in non-direct mode) 
	done by its COM.SYS driver!  There may be about 100 kilobytes
	of source code, but nearly 50% of this size are comments!
<p>
	This 16550A emulator never even touches the real serial ports,
	it merely traps port writes, and does the I/O via file functions
	on a device in /dev.  Interrupts are also simulated as necessary.
<p>
	One of the most important things to know before programming
	this serial code, is to understand how the com&lsqb;&rsqb; array works.  
<p>
	Most of the serial variables are stored in the com&lsqb;&rsqb; array.
	The com&lsqb;&rsqb; array is a structure in itself.   Take a look at the
	'serial_t' struct declaration in the ../include/serial.h module 
	for more info about this.  Only the most commonly referenced 
	global variables are listed here:

<descrip>
	<tag/config.num_ser/         Number of serial ports active.
	<tag/com&lsqb;x&rsqb;.base_port/       The base port address of emulated serial port.
	<tag/com&lsqb;x&rsqb;.real_comport/    The COM port number.
	<tag/com&lsqb;x&rsqb;.interrupt/       The PIC interrupt level (based on IRQ number)
	<tag/com&lsqb;x&rsqb;.mouse/           Flag  mouse (to enable extended features)
	<tag/com&lsqb;x&rsqb;.fd/              File descriptor for port device 
	<tag/com&lsqb;x&rsqb;.dev&lsqb;&rsqb;/           Filename of port port device
	<tag/com&lsqb;x&rsqb;.dev_locked/      Flag whether device has been locked
</descrip>

	The arbritary example variable 'x' in com&lsqb;x&rsqb; can have a minimum 
	value of 0 and a maximum value of (config.numser - 1).  There 
	can be no gaps for the value 'x', even though gaps between actual 
	COM ports are permitted.  It is strongly noted that the 'x' does 
	not equal the COM port number.  This example code illustrates 
	the fact, and how the com&lsqb;x&rsqb; array works:
<tscreen><verb>
	  for (i = 0; i < config.numser; i++)
	    s_printf("COM port number %d has a base address of %x", 
	             com&lsqb;i&rsqb;.real_comport, com&lsqb;i&rsqb;.base_port);
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>DEBUGGING HELP
<p>
	If you require heavy debugging output for serial operations,
	please take a look in ./ser_defs.h for the following defines:
<descrip>
	<tag/SER_DEBUG_MAIN   (0 or 1)/
	   extra debug output on the most critical information.

	<tag/SER_DEBUG_HEAVY   (0 or 1)/
	  super-heavy extra debug output, including all ports reads 
	    and writes, and every character received and transmitted!

	<tag/SER_DEBUG_INTERRUPT   (0 or 1)/
	  additional debug output related to serial interrupt code,
	    including flagging serial interrupts, or PIC-driven code.

	<tag/SER_DEBUG_FOSSIL_RW   (0 or 1)/
	  heavy FOSSIL debug output, including all reads and writes.

	<tag/SER_DEBUG_FOSSIL_STATUS   (0 or 1)/
	  super-heavy FOSSIL debug output, including all status checks.
</descrip>



<sect1>FOSSIL EMULATION
<p>
	The FOSSIL emulation requires a memory-resident DOS module,
	FOSSIL.COM. If you don't load it, the code in fossil.c does nothing,
	permitting you to use another FOSSIL driver such as X00 or BNU.
<p>
	The emulation isn't as complete as it could be. Some calls aren't
	implemented at all. However, the programs I've tried don't seem to
	use these calls. Check fossil.c if you're interested in details.
<p>
	I've done only minimal testing on this code, but at least the
	performance seems to be quite good. Depending on system load, I got
	Zmodem speeds ranging from 1500 to nearly 3800 cps over a 38400 bps
	null-modem cable when sending data to another PC. Zmodem receive,
	however, was only about 2200 cps, since Linux tried to slow down the
	sender with flow control (I'm not sure why).
