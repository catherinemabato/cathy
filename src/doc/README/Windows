<title>Running Windows under DOSEMU</title>

<para>
Okay, perhaps you've heard the hooplah.  DOSEMU can run Windows (sort of.)

<title>Windows 3.0 Real Mode</title>

<para>
DOSEMU has been able to run Windows 3.0 in Real Mode for some time now.
If you really, really, really want to run Windows under DOSEMU, this is the
route to take for the moment.

Okay, it is possible to boot WINOS2 (the modified version of Windows 3.1
that OS/2 uses) under DOSEMU.  Many kudos to Lutz &#38; Dong!
</para>

<para>
However, YOU NEED <emphasis remap="bf">BOTH</emphasis> LICENSES, for WINDOWS-3.1 as well OS/2 !!!
</para>

<para>
There are many known problems.  Windows is prone to crash, could take data
with it, large programs will not load, etc. etc. etc.
In other words, it is NOT ready for daily use.  Many video cards are known
to have problems (you may see a nice white screen, however, look below
for win31-in-xdos).  Your program groups are all likely to disappear.
Basically, it's a pain.
</para>

On the other hand, if you're dying to see the little Windows screen running
under Linux and you have read this CAREFULLY and PROMISE NOT TO BOMBARD THE
DOSEMU DEVELOPERS WITH "MS Word 6.0 doesn't run!!!" MESSAGES

  Get the OS2WIN31.ZIP distribution from somehere.
oh well, and now you have the first problem.
It _was_ on ibm.com sometime ago, but has vanished from that site, and
as long as it was there, we could mirror it. ,,,, you see the problem?
However, use 'archie' to find it, it will be around somewhere on the net
... for some time ;-)

<title>Windows 3.x in xdos</title>

<para>
As of version 0.64.3 DOSEMU is able to run Windows in xdos. Of course, this
is not recommended at all, but if you really want to try, it is safer then
starting windows-31 on the console, because <emphasis>when</emphasis> it crashes, it doesn't
block your keyboard or freeze your screen.

Notes for the mouse under win31-in-xdos:
</para>

<para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
 In order to let the mouse properly work you need the following in your
win.ini file:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
     [windows]
     MouseThreshold1=0
     MouseThreshold2=0
     MouseSpeed=0
</screen>

</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 The mouse cursor gets not painted by X, but by windows itself, so it depends
on the refresh rate how often it gets updated, though the mouse coordinates 
movement itself will not get delayed.
( In fact you have 2 cursors, but the X-cursor is given an 'invisible'
cursor shape while within the DOS-Box. )
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 Because the coordinates passed to windows are interpreted relatively, we
need to calibrate the cursor. This is done automatically whenever you
enter the DOS-Box window: The cursor gets forced to 0,0 and then back
to its right coordinates. Hence, if you want to re-calibrate the cursor,
just move the cursor outside and then inside the DOS-Box again.
