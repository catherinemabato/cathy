created to deal with the lack of DOSEmu documentation.

<sect>Introduction

<P>
This documentation is derived from a number of smaller documents. This makes it
easier for individuals to maintain the documentation relevant to their area of
expertise. Previous attempts at documenting DOSEmu failed because the
documentation on a large project like this quickly becomes too much for one
person to handle.
