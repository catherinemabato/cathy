To put it brief, mkfatimage creates a hdimage file for dosemu that's
pre-loaded with the files specified on the command line. It's purpose is to
remove the need to include a hdimage.dist file in the dosemu distribution
(and it saves about 100K in the .tar.gz size on the way).
<p>
I haven't done any modifications to the makefiles since they're changing all
the time anyway, but the idea is to run mkfatimage after compiling dosemu to
create a hdimage of the programs in the commands directory. An additional
benefit is that we always get the most recent versions (since they were just
compiled).
<p>
As always, comments, suggestions, etc. are welcome.
