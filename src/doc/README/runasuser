 You have to copy 'dosemu.bin to 'dosemu.suidbin' and make it suid root,
if you want a fullfeature DOSEMU.
But as of dosemu-0.97.10, you need not if you don't access to ports,
external DOSish hardware and won't use the console other then
in normal terminal mode

<para>
  For older DOSEMU system wide installations,
you can restrict access to the suid root binary via /etc/dosemu.user.
by specifying `nosuidroot' for a given user (or all).

<para>
 Have the users that are allow to execute dosemu in /etc/dosemu.user.
The format is:

For details see <xref linkend="config">. For a first 
time <emphasis>easy</emphasis> installation you may set it as follows (but don't 
forget to enhance it later !!!):

     root c_all
     lermen c_all
     all nosuidroot c_all

 The msdos partitions, that you want to be accessable through 
<xref linkend="lredir"> should
be mounted with proper permissions. I recommend doing this via 'group's,
not via user ownership. Given you have a group 'dosemu' for this and want
to give the user 'lermen' access, then the following should be

 in /etc/passwd:

The fstab entry will mount /dosc such that is has the proper permissions

<screen>
   ( drwxrwxr-x  22 root     dosemu      16384 Jan  1  1970 /dosc )
</screen>

</para>

<para>
You can do the same with an explicit mount command:

<screen>
      mount -t msdos -o gid=200,umask=002 /dev/hda1 /dosc 
</screen>

</para>

<para>
Of course normal lredir'ed unix directories should have the same 
permissions.

<para>
 Make sure you have read/write permissions of the devices you
configured (in /etc/dosemu.conf) for serial and mouse.

Starting with dosemu-0.66.1.4 there should be no reason against running
dosemu as a normal user. The privilege stuff has been extensively reworked,
and there was no program that I tested under root, that didn't also run
as user. Normally dosemu will permanently run as user and only temporarily
use root privilege when needed (during initialization) and then drop its
root privileges permanently. In case of non-suid root
(as of dosemu-0.97.10), it will run in lowfeature mode without any privileges.
