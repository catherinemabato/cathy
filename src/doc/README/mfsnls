<sect1>MFS and National Language Support
<p>
Main problem is that *nix and DOS uses codesets, which can differ. So,
in Russia the most popular codeset for *nix is koi8-r, while DOS
standard used so called `alternative' codeset cp866.

<p>
While DOSEMU access DOS partitions directly, through original DOS (V)FAT
drivers, it doesn't matter, that linux locales are set to koi8-r, and
all works correctly. However, in this way you cannot start more than one
copy of DOSEMU at the same time.

A more elegant solution (which in fact heavily supported by recent
development
of DOSEMU) is to mount all DOS partitions into linux filesystem and access
them through the `internal network' system MFS (Mach File System). It allows
use the security of real *nix (linux) filesystem, and one can have
simultaneously so many DOSEMU sessions, as he wants  ;-).


However, <em/new problems occur/:
<p>
<enum>
<item> Mount DOS partitions into Linux. Currently, linux kernel
  linux-2.0.34 support mounting both MSDOS and VFAT partitions. No problem is,
  if your DOS partition has true MSDOS format. More ambigious case is if your
  have VFAT partition. You can mount it as VFAT and get access to 'long names',
  which looks as very attractive option. But in this case you *have lost*
  any access to _short_filenames_ - DOS aliases of long filenames. To access
  <em/short_filenames/ you need mount VFAT partition as MSDOS (!) (I am not
  even sure, that this is completely safe (!)).

<item> IMPORTANT: mounting DOS partition, you optionally make filenames
  convertion from DOS codeset to Linux one, if you want to see filenames
  correctly (in Russia cp866 -> koi8-r). Otherwise I need to support both
  codesets in my Linux. (Currently I do no conversion and have on my console
  both codesets).

<item> Bug in MFS: transfer directory/file names from Linux to DOS via MFS
  includes also some name conversion from *nix standard to DOS one. In
  original (current in dosemu-0.97.10) release of MFS a lot of corresponding
  locale-dependent (!!!) char/string operations on _DOS_names_ were performed
  with _Linux_ locale setting (in my case koi8-r). As a result, one get a
  garbage instead of original filenames.

<item> If you mount VFAT partition in LINUX as VFAT, some of filenames are
  long. I fact, curent dosemu MFS system can `mangle' them, converting into
  short aliases. There is NO vay to reconstruct the <em/true/ DOS alias from
  <em/long_name_/, since in DOS created SFNAME~[index]  index value depends
  exceptionaly on the _history_ of file creation. As a result, `mangled'
  names differs from true DOS shortnames.
</enum>

<sect1>Patching of MFS
<p>
Presented patch of MFS cures problem (3) only. Summary of modification:
<itemize>

 <item> all locale-dependent code is removed from mfs.c and mangle.c
     and is located in file util.c only. Here I add a set of routins:
<tscreen><verb>
          islowerDOS(...)(+), tolowerDOS(...)(+),
          isupperDOS(...)(+), toupperDOS()(+),
          isalphaDOS(...)(+), isalnumDOS(...)(+),
          is_valid_DOS_char(...)(+), chrcmpDOS(...)(+),

          strlowerDOS(...), strhaslowerDOS(...),
          strupperDOS(...), strhasupperDOS(...),
          chrcmpDOS(...)(+), strncmpDOS(...), strcmpDOS(...),
          strncasecmpDOS(...), strcasecmpDOS(...).
</verb></tscreen>
     Upper part (marked by (+)) has all the information on the codesets,
     while lower part is derived from the upper one. Currently codepage 866
     implementation is completely sufficient for Russia (e.g for Ukrainian
     some definitions should be added). As for Western Europe latin codepages,
     some sort of support existed before is conserved. In any case, further
     addition of other codepages is quite easy.

 <item> file mangle.c was revised, and some dead code was excluded. To my
     opinion, this file need to be more critically revized: some stuff,
     (e.g. verification of 8.3 format) is duplicated in mfs.c, and other
     stuf looks too overcomplicated (am I right?). I have a suspection,
     that most of codes overlaps in functionality with those of mfs.c.
     Unfortunately, I have no time to examine the file mfs.c more carefully.

 <item> At last, I replace all locale-dependent operation in mangle.c and
     mfs.c by their DOS partners:  func() -&gt; funcDOS(), defined in util.c.
</itemize>

To patch MFS put patch.mfs into directory dosemu-0.97.10/src/dosext/mfs/
and issue a command
<tscreen><verb>
patch -p1 <patch.mfs
</verb></tscreen>
and then compile dosemu as usual.

<p>
To mount dos VFAT partition in Linux filesystem I do like as

</verb></tscreen>
mount -t vfat -o noexec,umask=022,gid=107,codepage=866,iocharset=cp866 /dev/hda1 /dos_C
</verb></tscreen>

(or corresponding line in /etc/fstab). In this vay I have dos names in the
`alternative' codepage 866. To operate them in Linux I turn console in
`altenative' charset mode (see, e.g. CYRILLIC-HOWTO).

<p>
NOTE: VFAT module in linux-2.0.34 seems to be buggy: Creating via Linux
filename with <em/lowercase/ russian letters, you obtain file not accessible
by DOS (or even Win95) - probably, people, who makes VFAT support have
forgotten creating shortname DOS alias from long names or short names
turn to upper case chars with ASCII codes &gt; 127 ? (To my first look,
they use tolower() and toupper() functions which works for ascii&lt;=127).
Fortunately, DOS creates filenames properly, even with cyrillic letters,
and creating files with russian names is completely safe.

<p>
In DOSEMU I load DOS (DOS-7) from hdimage.
To access dos partition in DOSEMU I have in config.sys two lines

<verb><tscreen>
     install=c:\subst.exe L: C:\
     install=c:\lredir.exe C: linux\fs/dos_C
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Obvious disadvantage of my approach: long filenames have short aliases
slightly different than in direct partition access. In practice, this
doesn't result in problem, since DOS stuff usually does not exploit long
filenames, and files with long filenames are irrelevant.

<sect1> TODO:
<p>
<enum>
<item> In Linux kernel: Cure in VFAT module upper/lowercase bugs for
  ascii&gt;127.

<item> In Linux kernel: VFAT module should provide access to short DOS aliases
  of long names, even if VFAT partition is mounted in longname support mode (with -t vfat).
<item> In dosemu MFS:
  MFS should use short DOS aliases, actually existing for VFAT longnames.
