<sect>Setting HogThreshold
<p>
Greetings DOSEMU fans,
<p>
Hogthreshold is a value that you may modify in your DOSEMU.CONF file.  It
is a measure of the "niceness" of Dosemu.  That is to say, it attempts to
return to Linux while DOS is 'idling' so that DOSEMU does not hog all the
CPU cycles while waiting at the DOS prompt.
<P>
Determining the optimal Hogthreshold value involves a little bit of magic
(but not so much really.)  One way is to try different values and look at
the 'top' reading in another console.  Setting the value too low may
mildly slow Dosemu performance.  Setting the value too high will keep the
idling code from working.
<p>
That said, a good basic value to try is "half of your Bogo-Mips value".
(The Bogo-Mips value is displayed when the kernel is booting, it's an
imaginary value somewhat related to CPU performance.)
<p>
Setting the value to 0 will disable idling entirely.  The default value is
10.

<p>
This files is some kind of FAQ on how to use the 'HogThreshold' value in the
dosemu config file.

<p>
In case you have more questions feel free to ask me (

<p>
Those of you who simply want to have DOSEMU running at highest possible speed
simply leave the value to zero, but if you are concerned about
DOSEMU eating too much CPU time it's worth playing with the HogThreshold value.

<tag>Why do I need to set the HogThreshold value, why can't DOSEMU
     just stop if it is waiting for a keystroke ?
</tag>
The reason is the way how DOS and a lot of applications have implemented
'waiting for a keystroke'.
<p>
It's most often done by something similar to the following code fragment :

<tscreen><verb>
wait_for_key:
	; do something
	mov ah,1
	int 0x16 ; check key status
	jz	wait_for_key ; jump if no key
	; found a key
        mov ah,0
        int 0x16 ; get key
</verb></tscreen>

This means that the application is busy waiting for the keystroke.

<tag>
What is a good value for HogThreshold to start with ?
</tag>
On a 40 MHZ 486 start with a value of 10.
Increase this value if you to have your DOS application run faster,
decrease it if you think too much CPU time is used.

<tag>
It does not work on my machine.
</tag>

You need to have at least dosemu0.53pl40 in order to have the
anti-hog code in effect.


<tag>
Why not simply use a very low value of "HogThreshold" ?
Do I really have to try an individual value of HogThreshold ?
</tag>
This would slow down your DOS application. But why not, DOS is slow
anyway :-).

<tag>
How do I found out about CPU usage of DOSEMU ?
</tag>
Simply use 'top'. It displays cpu and memory usage.
</descrip>

P.S.  If you want to change the HogThreshold value during execution,
simply call int e6h w/al=12h & bx=the new value.
This is what speed.com does. If you are interested, please take a look
at speed.c.
<p>
Notes:  If your application is unkind enough to do waits using an int16h
fcn 1h loop without calling the keyboard idle interrupt (int 28h), this
code is not going to help much.  If someone runs into a program like this,
let me (
<htmlurl url="mailto:scottb@eecs.nwu.edu" name="&lt;scottb@eecs.nwu.edu&gt;">
) know and I'll rewrite something into the
int16 bios.
