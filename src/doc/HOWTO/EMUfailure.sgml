<para>
This file list programs and groups of programms not running or running
only partial under dosemu.

Please report about possible additions to <emphasis remap="bf"><ulink

<title>Fundamental problem</title>

<para>
Programs that don't work under the MSDOS Emulator and probably
won't ever work, because of fundamental problem. Some of these
fundamental problems result in these programs not being runnable on
Win3.x/Win95/WinNT in a Dosbox and under OS/2 either. These programs
are characterized by using any of these features:
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI)</title>

<para>
VCPI allows programs to run in ring 0. This is kernel mode in Linux
and not sensible.
</para>

<para>
Example: sim2181.exe from Analog Devices DSP Kit
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Programs using older Versions of the Pharlap Extender </title>

<para>
The Pharlap Extender in it's older versions needed ring 0 access
too, so it can't me made working in the emulator.
</para>

<para>
Example:Autocad Version 12c1 For DOS
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>MSDOS enhanced mode Windows kernel krnl386.exe</title>

<para>
 krnl386.exe needs Ring 0 access too. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Windows programs using Win32s</title>

<para>
Win32s needs Ring 0 access too. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Does my failing program belong to these groups?</title>

<para>
Check with "strings &lt;program.exe&gt; | less" if the programm
contains some of these keywords <emphasis remap="bf"> vcpi, pharlap and win32s</emphasis>. Newer
Pharlap programs may work.

<title> Problems probably solved</title>

<title>Programs not working yet</title>

<para>
Here are programs listed, where someone has reported that it does
not work.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>dd2demo.exe</title>

<para>
 This is a game found at 

<screen>
<ulink
url="http://www.psygnosis.com/"
>http://www.psygnosis.com/</ulink
>
</screen>

Reported by Hans Lermen, it kills dosemu, giving an output like:

<screen>
general protection at 0x1fba: a7
ERROR: SIGSEGV, protected insn...exiting!
</screen>

The crash happens in DMPI Call 0x0302
At least DMPI Call 0x0506 is not yet implemented.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>bae.exe</title>

<para>
This is a demo version of an Electronic CAD programm, found at

<screen>
<ulink
url="http://www.bartels.de/"
>http://www.bartels.de/</ulink
>
</screen>

Reported by Uwe Bonnes, it stops dosemu with a blank screen in an
unusable state. You have to do a remote login to kill dosemu, or hit
reset with all it's possible fatal result. The possible reason is the
missing implementation of DMPI Call 0x0800, as Uwe Bonnes reported it
once working on the console with some hack.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>tasmx.exe </title>

<para>
Reported by vignani@mail.tin.it (Alberto Vignani):
Protected-mode version of the Borland Turbo Assembler. It crashes with
"out of memory" at startup. I traced it at the assembly level, no result
until now. Maybe a DPMI problem (97/03/04).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>xaos.exe</title>

<para>
Reported by vignani@mail.tin.it (Alberto Vignani):
Mandelbrot zoomer, version 2.2 under djgpp, using Allegro 2.1 library.
Can be found on any simtelnet mirror (xaos22b.exe?)
Any mouse movement (in console mode with a button pressed) crashes it
(97/03/04).
</para>

<sect2>
<title>QIC tape programs</title>

<para>
Reported by vignani@mail.tin.it (Alberto Vignani):
Tape is not supported. Worse, if you use a floppy under dosemu, you
have sometimes to remove/reinstall the ftape module.
</para>

<para>
