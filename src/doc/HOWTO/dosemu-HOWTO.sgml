This is the `Frequently Asked Questions' (FAQ) / HOWTO document for
dosemu.  The most up-to-date version of the dosemu-HOWTO may be found

</artheader>

<sect1>
<title>The preliminaries</title>

<sect2>
<title>What is dosemu, anyway?</title>

<para>
To quote the manual, "dosemu" is a user-level program which uses
certain special features of the Linux kernel and the 80386 processor
to run MS-DOS/FreeDOS/DR-DOS in what we in the biz call a `DOS box.'  
The DOS box, a combination of hardware and software trickery, has these 
capabilities:
</para>

<para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
 the ability to virtualize all input/output and processor control
instructions
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 the ability to support the word size and addressing modes of the
iAPX86 processor family's "real mode," while still running within
the full protected mode environment
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 the ability to trap all DOS and BIOS system calls and emulate such
calls as are necessary for proper operation and good performance
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 the ability to simulate a hardware environment over which DOS
programs are accustomed to having control.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 the ability to provide DOS services through native Linux
services; for example, dosemu can provide a virtual hard disk
drive which is actually a Linux directory hierarchy."
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>What operating systems does dosemu work under ?</title>

<para>
Dosemu is primarily written for Linux. It also works on NetBSD and
possibly FreeBSD, however the graphics emulation is unlikely to work
on NetBSD, which means that all DOS programs that use graphics mode
(most DOS programs) will not work under NetBSD.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>What processors does dosemu work on ?</title>

<para>
Dosemu only works on Intel 80x86 processors, e.g. 80386, 80486, 
Pentium etc.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>What if I have an Alpha/Sparc/Motorola/other non-Intel CPU ?</title>

<para>
Dosemu only works on Intel 80x86 processors but there are alternatives:
Bochs (<emphasis remap="bf"><ulink
url="http://www.bochs.com"
>http://www.bochs.com</ulink
></emphasis>) is an open
source shareware PC emulator that
runs on most Unixes (as well as MS-Windows), and there are other
(non-free) alternatives - see the comp.emulators.misc FAQ, available via
usenet or <emphasis remap="bf"><ulink
url="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/comp/emulators/misc/"
>ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/comp/emulators/misc/</ulink
></emphasis>
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Do I need MS-DOS to use dosemu ?</title>

<para>
No. You need some version of DOS but not necessarily MS-DOS.
See the section "What versions of DOS are known to run with dosemu ?"
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Can I run Microsoft Windows programs under dosemu ?</title>

<para>
Not reliably. You would be better to use the Windows emulator
Wine (<emphasis remap="bf"><ulink
url="http://www.winehq.com"
>http://www.winehq.com</ulink
></emphasis>). If you insist on running Windows
under dosemu, see section 8 - dosemu and MS-Windows 3.1.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>I want to run something that won't run under DOSemu or Wine</title>

<para>
See section 1.4.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Names and numbers</title>

<para>

<screen>
(xx/yy/zz) means day zz in month yy in year xx.
</screen>


<screen>
winemu mean WinOS/2 running in dosemu.
</screen>

</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>What version of Dosemu should I use?</title>

<para>
Dosemu uses the same numbering scheme as the kernel. Uneven second
numbers are for possible unstable developer releases, even second numbers
are for releases considered stable. At the time of writing, <emphasis remap="bf">1.0.0</emphasis>
is the latest stable release, while <emphasis remap="bf">1.1.0</emphasis> is the latest
developer's release. So if you want to use dosemu, get the latest 
<emphasis remap="bf">stable</emphasis> release. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>What's the newest version of dosemu and where can I get it?</title>

<para>
The newest version of dosemu as of 2000/02/28 is
<emphasis remap="bf">dosemu-1.0.0</emphasis> and can be ftp'ed from:

<screen>
<ulink
url="ftp://ftp.dosemu.org/pub/dosemu/"
>ftp://ftp.dosemu.org/pub/dosemu/</ulink
>
</screen>
 
</para>

<para>
We just decided to leave BETA stage, however: there may be serious bugs
and very little documentation for new features. The development version 
is particularly likely to have bugs. Please use it only if you
like to do active development. Don't report bugs in the development
version, fix them instead.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Where can I ask questions?</title>

<para>
If you have problems regarding installing and running dosemu after
reading the documentation, first try to help yourself: Your question
has probably been asked and perhaps answered before. Try some search
engine on the internet to retrieve that information. E.g. you can ask

<screen>
<ulink
url="http://www.dejanews.com"
>http://www.dejanews.com</ulink
>
</screen>

</para>

<para>
to find all newsnet articles containing the keywords of your
question. Helping yourself will probably be faster than asking a well
known question. It also frees up the time of developers from answering
trivial question and so helps the further development of dosemu.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Where can I report bugs and ask questions?</title>

<para>
If you want to ask questions and report bugs regarding dosemu, you
should consider subscribing to the linux-msdos mailing list.
To subscribe, send mail to <emphasis remap="bf"><ulink
url="mailto:Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu"
>Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</ulink
></emphasis>
with the following command in the body of your email message:

<screen>
subscribe linux-msdos your_username@your.email.address
</screen>

If you ever want to remove yourself from the mailing list, you can
send mail to <emphasis remap="bf"><ulink
url="mailto:Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu"
>Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</ulink
></emphasis>
with the following command in the body of your email message:

<screen>
unsubscribe linux-msdos your_username@your.email.address
</screen>

(95/8/11). When you are subscribed to linux-msdos, you can send your
report as mail to linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu. There is a gate that
send mails to linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu as postings to the
newsgroup named <emphasis remap="bf">linux.dev.msdos</emphasis>. If your News provider
doesn't carry that group, ask her(him) to add that group. 
Before you ask a question, you should carefully read all of the
documentation, including this HOWTO and check one of the mailing list
archives listed at <emphasis remap="bf"><ulink
url="http://www.dosemu.org/mailinglist.html"
>http://www.dosemu.org/mailinglist.html</ulink
></emphasis> to see whether your
question has already been asked and answered.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>What documentation is available for dosemu?</title>

<para>
Dosemu comes with documentation. The main documentation files
README.txt and README-tech.txt cover virtually all aspects of dosemu
and may be more up-to-date than this HOWTO.
</para>

<para>
The "dosemu Novice's Altering Guide" or DANG is a road map to the
inner workings of dosemu.  It is designed for the adventurous, those
who wish to modify the source code themselves.  The DANG is maintained
by Alistair MacDonald (<emphasis remap="bf"><ulink
url="mailto:alistair@slitesys.demon.co.uk"
>alistair@slitesys.demon.co.uk</ulink
></emphasis>) and is
found in the doc directory of the dosemu source tree.
</para>

<para>
The EMU failure list (EMUfailure.txt) is a partial list of programs known
<emphasis remap="bf">not</emphasis> to work under dosemu. 
</para>

<para>
And then, of course, there is the dosemu FAQ/HOWTO.  But you already
know about that, don't you.  It is also posted once in a while to the
mailing list and found in the doc-directory.  The most recent version
can be found at <emphasis remap="bf"><ulink
url="http://www.dosemu.org"
>http://www.dosemu.org</ulink
></emphasis>.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>I have a program that fails, not listed in EMUfailure.txt </title>

<para>
First check, if the failure of your program is not caused by some
of the fundamental incapabilities of dosemu, listed in EMUfailure.txt. If
you think you have something new, please report to 
<ulink
url="mailto:linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu"
>linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu</ulink
>.
Perhaps it can be made going with the help others. Give detailed
information about your setup, tell the version of kernel, dosemu etc
and name the observed errors. You can use xdos to cut and paste the
error message into your report. But keep your report in a readable
form. We know the content of ../etc/config.dist. So only send the
active lines from your dosemu.conf. Try running dosemu with some or all
debug output turned on and scan through your debug output
and at first only send those parts you think are relevant. Few people
are willing to decode some long attachment to a mail, to do debugging
for others. But keep your logs at hand, in case others ask detailed
questions.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>How do I submit changes or additions to the HOWTO?</title>

<para>
The preferred method is to edit the file
<emphasis remap="bf">dosemu-HOWTO-xx.x.sgml</emphasis> to incorporate the changes, create a
diff file by typing something like
</para>

<para>

<screen>
diff -uw original-file new-file
</screen>

</para>

<para>
and send it to <emphasis remap="bf"><ulink
url="mailto:davidhodges@altavista.iname.com"
>davidhodges@altavista.iname.com</ulink
></emphasis>.
If you do not know SGML, that's ok.  Changes or new information in any
form will be accepted.  Creating the diff file just makes it easier on
the HOWTO maintainer.  :-)

<para>
1. Forgetting to read the <emphasis remap="bf">QuickStart</emphasis> Guide.
</para>

<para>
2. Try to compile some old version of dosemu.
</para>

<para>
3. Try to compile with a kernel older than 2.0.28 or 2.1.15.
</para>

<para>
4. Having the wrong linux kernel source sitting in <emphasis remap="bf">/usr/src/linux</emphasis>
or missing <emphasis remap="bf">/usr/src/linux/include/version.h</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
5. Use dosemu with a kernel that does not have <emphasis remap="bf">IPC</emphasis> compiled in.
</para>

<para>
6. Compile with gcc older than 2.7.2 or libc older than 5.x.x.
</para>

<para>
7. Forget to edit your <emphasis remap="bf">/etc/dosemu.conf</emphasis>, <emphasis remap="bf">/etc/dosemu.users</emphasis>
and <emphasis remap="bf">/var/lib/dosemu/global.conf</emphasis> files
</para>

<para>
8. Run DOSEMU with partition access while they are already mounted.
</para>

<para>
9. Don't install dosemu with sufficient privileges (i.e., root).
</para>

<para>
10. Try to run programs that use DPMI without enabling dpmi in
/etc/dosemu.conf
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>How do I make aout binaries?</title>

<para>
 Starting with version 0.64.4 there is no a.out support any more.
If you absolutely need it, you must use version 0.64.3.1.
The configure script then should take care for this, if you setup is a
standard setup. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>How do I compile dosemu on a machine with low memory?</title>

<para>
Marty Leisner (<emphasis remap="bf">leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com</emphasis>) reported (95/4/8)
that
</para>

<para>
If you have problems with running out of swap space you may want to
add <literal remap="tt">CFLAGS+=-fno-inline</literal> after <literal remap="tt">CFLAGS</literal> is defined in
<emphasis remap="bf">dpmi/Makefile</emphasis>.  Be careful before you do this and check for
the existence of swap space.  I found Linux crashes at times when it
has no swap space.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Compilation fails with some strange error regarding "slang"</title>

<para>
You probably have

<screen>
slangforce off
</screen>

in your compiletime-settings file. You need to change it to

<screen>
slangforce on
</screen>

and recompile.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>What configurable options are available ?</title>

<para>
The compiletime-settings.help file describes the options you can change
at compile time. The README.txt file describes the options you can
change at run time.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Do I need to run dosemu as root?</title>

<para>
No. Although dosemu drops root privilege wherever possible, it is still 
safer to not run dosemu as root, especially if you run DPMI
programs under dosemu. Most normal DOS applications don't need dosemu
to run as root, especially if you run dosemu under X. 
Thus you should not allow users to run a suid root copy of dosemu,
wherever possible, but only a non-suid copy. You can configure this on
a per-user basis using the /etc/dosemu.users file.
</para>

<para>
Programs that require direct access to hardware ports (e.g. if the
program needs to talk to some unusual hardware that is not supported
by Linux and dosemu) require dosemu to run as root but printers,
serial ports, mice, video cards and sound are emulated by dosemu so
you won't usually need direct hardware access and won't need to
run as root to use these. Some programs are just too sneaky for
dosemu's hardware emulation to work properly though ...
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>How do I patch dosemu ?</title>

<para>
If you do patch dosemu from one version to another, do 
&quot;make pristine;./configure; make&quot;. 
If you don't make pristine, at least the version
of the new executable will be wrong, if the whole thing compiles at
all(97/2/9).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>What versions of DOS are known to run with dosemu ?</title>

<para>
All versions of DOS should work with dosemu, with the following caveats:
</para>

<para>
FreeDOS (<emphasis remap="bf"><ulink
url="http://www.freedos.org"
>http://www.freedos.org</ulink
></emphasis>) does not 
(yet) have a working redirector so you will
not be able to access your Linux filesystem or Novell networking under
FreeDOS. Note also that FreeDOS is unreliable beta software and may
crash unexpectedly, trash its filesystem, etc. etc.
</para>

<para>
DOS 4.01 had problems by itself, so it won't work reliably with dosemu 
either.
</para>

<para>
With <emphasis remap="bf">MsDos-7</emphasis> aka <emphasis remap="bf">Win95</emphasis> you must not start the graphic shell 
at bootup. If you make the hdimage bootable with the so called "Rescue Disk"
you are offered to make during the Windows installation, you get the right
settings. If you use your normal Win95 installation to transfer the system
files, have a look at the msdos.sys written on the hdimage and change the
settings under the section [Options] to have entries like

<screen>
[Options]
Logo=0
BootGUI=0
</screen>

</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Hard disk setup</title>

<sect2>
<title>How do I use my hard disk with dosemu?</title>

<para>
First, mount your dos hard disk partition as a Linux subdirectory.
For example, you could create a directory in Linux such as /dos (mkdir
-m 755 /dos) and add a line like

<screen>
/dev/hda1       /dos     msdos   umask=022
</screen>

to your /etc/fstab.  (In this example, the partition is mounted
read-only.  You may want to mount it read/write by replacing "022"
with "000" and using the -m 777 option with mkdir).  Now <emphasis remap="bf">mount
/dos</emphasis>.  
</para>

<para>
The README.txt says:
</para>

<para>
  you just can have a Linux directory containing all what you
  want to have under your DOS C:. Copy your IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS or what
  ever to that directory (e.g. /var/lib/dosemu/bootdir), put
</para>

<para>

<screen>
$_hdimage = "bootdir"
</screen>

</para>

<para>
  into your /etc/dosemu.conf, and up it goes. DOSEMU makes a lredir'ed
  drive out of it and can boot from it. You can edit the config.sys and
  the autoexec.bat within this directory before you start dosemu.  Fur-
  ther more, you may have a more sohisticated setup. Given you want to
  run the same DOS drive as you normal have when booting into native
  DOS, then you just mount you DOS partition under Linux (say to /dos)
  and put links to its subdirectories into the boot dir. This way you
  can decide which files/directories have to be visible under DOSEMU and
  which have to be different. Here's a small and incomplete example
  bootdir setup:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
config.sys
autoexec.bat
command.com -&#62; /dos/command.com
io.sys -&#62; /dos/io.sys
msdos.sys -&#62; /dos/msdos.sys
dos -&#62; /dos/dos
bc -&#62; /dos/bc
windows -&#62; /dos/windows
</screen>

</para>

<para>
  There is, however, one drawback, you can't use the DosC kernel
  (FreeDos) for it, because it hasn't yet a working redirector (will
  hopefully be available some time in the future).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>How can I access the hdimage from Linux?</title>

<para>
Use mtools. With a line in <emphasis remap="bf">/etc/mtools.conf</emphasis> like 

<screen>
drive n:  file="/var/lib/dosemu/hdimage" MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK=1 \
MTOOLS_LOWER_CASE=1 MTOOLS_NO_VFAT=1 partition=1 offset=128
</screen>

you can use the mtools on the hdimage, like "mdir n:". "mcopy
n:/config.emu /tmp" copies the config.emu file from the hdimage to
/tmp/config.emu. You can edit it there and copy it back. Use a drive
letter you find sensible. "N:" is only an example.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Can I use my stacked/double-spaced/super-stored disk?</title>

<para>
At this time, compressed drives cannot be accessed via the
redirector (lredir or emufs) on a standard kernel. There is a patch
for the kernel to mount compressed files under the name "dmsdosfs".
Find it on sunsite.unc.edu and its mirrors

<screen>
<ulink
url="http://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/"
>http://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/</ulink
>
</screen>

A good idea is also to look in <ulink
url="http://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming"
>http://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming</ulink
> for
a newer version. 
The "wholedisk" option in older versions of dosemu is no longer
allowed in recent versions, however, a line like

<screen>
$_hdimage = "/dev/hda1"
</screen>

may work, at the risk that you could lose all data in that partition
on a dosemu crash.
</para>

<para>
If your dos partition is already mounted with write access and you try
to run dosemu with partition access, dosemu will print a
warning message and abort.  This prevents DOS and Linux from making
independent writes to your disk and trashing the data on your dos
partition(95/8/11).
</para>

<para>
---------------------
</para>

<para>
If LILO is installed, the above will not work.  However...

I am running Linux 1.1.13 and want to point out a great feature that

What is really great (IMHO) is the screen commands (the CTRL-A cmds)
still work. This means I can do a CTRL-A C and add another unix shell,

1. Dosemu has X support compiled in. This is default, however
if you you have compiled dosemu with "x off" in the
compiletime-settings file you don't have X support. So changing
"x off" to "x on" in the compiletime-settings file, followed by
"make pristine; make; make install" should build 
you a dosemu-executable with X support, if you have the 
X-libraries installed in /usr/X11R6.
2. Set up your X key-mappings.  In an xterm, type
xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = 0xff08"
xmodmap -e "keycode 107 = 0xffff"
These lines fix the backspace and delete keys respectively.
3. Configure the X-related configuration options in your

Alternatively, you can run dosemu inside a color xterm,

You need to install windows from Dos. You can copy the windows tree to

You have windows in d:\windows
You have d:\ mounted as /dosc in Linux
You copy the windows tree to Linux,

Inside dosemu you redirect the copied tree like
lredir d: linux\fs\dosd

[windows]
MouseThreshold1=0

</para>

<para>
3. The mouse cursor gets not painted by X, but by windows itself, so it depends
on the refresh rate how often it gets updated, though the mouse coordinates
movement itself will not get delayed.
( In fact you have 2 cursors, but the X-cursor is given an `invisible'
cursor shape while within the DOS-Box. )
</para>

<para>
4. Because the coordinates passed to windows are interpreted relatively, we
need to calibrate the cursor. This is done automatically whenever you
enter the DOS-Box window: The cursor gets forced to 0,0 and then back
to its right coordinates. Hence, if you want to re-calibrate the cursor,
just move the cursor outside and then inside the DOS-Box again.

</para>

<para>
With the recent DPMI improvements that has gone into 0.60, you can now
run some 32-bit video games in dosemu.   If the game is compatible in
an OS/2 DOS box, there are chances that it will work in dosemu.
(Example 32-bit games include Descent, Dark Forces, Mortal Kombat 2, 
Rise of The Triad, which have all successfully been tested in recent 
dosemu releases).
</para>

<para>
Before you attempt to run a video game, you must have the keyboard
configured in raw keyboard mode and enabled VGA graphics modes, in the
<emphasis remap="bf">/etc/dosemu.conf</emphasis> file.

<para>
Note that game timers can be a little bit slow, due to
Linux multitasking and lack of high-frequency timer support.  So the
games may run from anywhere from 5 to 100 percent speed.  Typically,
the speed is approximately 50 percent in recent dosemu releases and is
expected to improve eventually.
</para>

<para>
Who knows, it might even work. If you can't get it to work, check
EMUfailure.txt if the program is listed there, or falls in a category of

There is a security hole when having enabled DPMI and having dosemu
suid root (especially when using dos4gw-based games), the client is able
to access the whole user space, hence also can modify the dosemu code

sound-usage.txt for information on setting this up. It may not
work for everything. Programs that are known to work are Impulse
Tracker and most games. One that is known not to work well is
FastTracker II.

If you have trouble getting sound to work at all, make sure you
have a working OSS driver and have configured everything properly
as described in sound-usage.txt. If most of your sound software
works but some programs don't detect sound, make sure your BLASTER
environment variable is set properly. Finally, make sure you are
aware of the difference between digital sound, FM, and MIDI; it
may be, for example, that you have digital sound working but MIDI
isn't set up properly.

If you believe DOSEMU really is having trouble with a specific
program, and it isn't a configuration error on your part, then
please, submit a bug report! Have a look at sound-usage.txt for
information on getting debugging output.

<title>Security issues</title>

<para>
A full featured Dosemu needs to be suid root, e.g to access ports. 
Most dos programs don't need this however so when running under X you
usually do not need to run dosemu as root.
Dosemu runs as suid "root" only where it is needed, and releases this right
thereafter. But with DPMI, the Dos client programm can access the whole user
space, hence also can modify the dosemu code itself. Use of the `secure'
option in /etc/dosemu.conf disables this.
There are several other important security considerations discussed in the 
Security section of the README.txt file.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>dosemu says "ERROR: general protection" and terminates when I run some program</title>

<para>
This will happen if your program uses DPMI and you do not have DPMI
enabled. Try changing the line 

<screen>
$_dpmi = (off)
</screen>

in /etc/dosemu.conf to

<screen>
$_dpmi = (nnnn)
</screen>

where nnnn is the number of kilobytes of memory you wish to give to
the DOS program (e.g. Doom requires about 4000 kilobytes). If you do
this, you should not run dosemu as root (see the Security Issues section) - 
it is better not to run dosemu as root whenever possible, in any case.
</para>

<para>
Another likely cause is that your program uses VCPI (see EMUfailure.txt
for more details) or some other means of switching to protected mode 
(other than DPMI), in which case it will never work under dosemu.
</para>

<para>
If none of these is the case, see section 1.14 I have a program that 
fails, not listed in EMUfailure.txt.

<title>Dosemu dies when booting. I have Win95 installed.</title>

<para>
Dosemu relies that the Dos-Version on the hdimage and the Drive you map
to contain command.com are the same. If not, dosemu will crash sooner or
later. With the dual boot option Win95 offers when pressing the F4,F5 and
F8 Keys with the "Starting Win95" text, versions on the Win95 drive may
swap. Take special care for command.com. Let your shell variable in
config.emu point to the correct static version of command.com, e.g.:
shell=c:\win95\command.com c:\ /P /E:1024 (97/02/28)

<title>Dosemu crashed and now I can't type anything.</title>

<para>
Daniel Barlow(jo95004@sable.ox.ac.uk) reported (95/4/8) that
</para>

<para>
If you have no terminal or network access that you can use to log in,
you may have to press the reset button.  If you can still get a usable
shell somehow, run "<literal remap="tt">kbd_mode -a</literal>" to switch the keyboard out of
raw mode, and/or "<literal remap="tt">stty sane</literal>" on the console so that you can see
what you're typing.
</para>

<para>
A useful thing to do is to use a script to run dosemu, and run
"<literal remap="tt">kbd_mode -a</literal>" automatically right after dosemu.  When dosemu
crashes, the script usually will resume running, and execute the
"<literal remap="tt">kbd_mode -a</literal>" command.

<title>My CDROM drive has problems reading some files under dosemu.</title>

<para>
Vinod G Kulkarni (<emphasis remap="bf">vinod@cse.iitb.ernet.in</emphasis>) reported
(94/4/7) that 
</para>

<para>
When a CDROM is mounted from linux and used from within dosemu (mapped
drive), there could be some problems. The CD-ROM driver (iso9660) in
the kernel tries to find out the type of the file (i.e. binary or
text).  If it can't find, it tries to guess the type of the file using
a heuristic. This heuristic fails under some circumstances when a
(almost) text file is to be treated as binary.  (I do not know if it
is a bug or feature.)
</para>

<para>
The result of this is that if you copy such a file from CD-ROM (from
linux itself, and not necessarily dosemu), the resulting file will be
usually bigger than original file. (Blanks get added before
<literal remap="tt">^J</literal>,<literal remap="tt">^M</literal>.)  So a program running in dosemu gives an error or
hangs, which may be mistaken as problem of dosemu.
</para>

<para>
Rob Janssen (<emphasis remap="bf">pe1chl@rabo.nl</emphasis>) reported (94/8/10) that 
</para>

<para>
The way to solve this is to turn off conversion altogether.  Pass the
option "<emphasis remap="bf">-o conv=binary</emphasis>" to the mount command mounting the
CD-ROM, or use the following in <emphasis remap="bf">/etc/fstab</emphasis>:

<screen>
/dev/cdrom	/cdrom		iso9660	conv=binary,ro
</screen>

No patches to the kernel are necessary.

As of dosemu 0.60, debugging output is redirected to a file specified

need to redirect <literal remap="tt">stderr</literal>.

<title>Why are my keystrokes echoed ttwwiiccee??</title>

<para>
Nick Holloway (<emphasis remap="bf">alfie@dcs.warwick.ac.uk</emphasis>) reported (94/2/22)
that
</para>

<para>
After running dos after playing with some stty settings, I was getting
doubled key presses.  I can now reveal what the reason is!
</para>

<para>
It only happens when dos is run on the console with `istrip' set.  This is
(I think) because the raw scancodes are mutilated by the `istrip',
so that key release events look like key press events.
</para>

<para>
So, the input processing needs to be turned off when using the scan
codes on a console (it wouldn't be a good idea to do it for tty lines).

<title>Dosemu scrambles my screen?</title>

<para>
 For those graphics cards not fully supported in dosemu, with allowed
console graphics a dosemu crash may leave your console in a scrambles and
nearly unusable way. To prepare for that situation, Spudgun
&lt;spudgun@earthlight.co.nz&gt; posted the following solution. First save your
registers when running on the console
~&gt; cat /usr/bin/savetextmode
~&gt; restoretextmode -w /etc/textregs
~&gt; restorefont -w /etc/fontdata
Then, when a crash happened, run following script:
restoretextmode -r /etc/textregs
restorefont -r /etc/fontdata
restorepalette
</para>

<para>
<emphasis remap="bf">If it doesn't fix it nothing will</emphasis>
I also found having an X server running sometimes put my Vid card's
registers into a strange state where this script made things worse
I think since changing X servers and/or running savetextmode on a vt while X
was running helped. (97/04/08)
