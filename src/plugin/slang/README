This is a stripped down version of the S-Lang library 1.4.8,
just containing everything needed for DOSEMU and nothing else.
The full version can be obtained at
http://www.s-lang.org

Two reasons to include this:
* you don't need to install slang-devel if you compile DOSEMU
* some mainstream distributions distribute S-Lang libraries
  with (unofficial) UTF8 support. This, while nice in theory,
  breaks SLsmg_Display_Eight_Bit.
