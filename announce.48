======================= DOSEMU ANNOUNCEMENT ==============================

I have put dosemu48.tar.Z onto tsx-11.mit.edu in the
/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu directory.

dosemu48.tar.Z is a collection of my enhanced sources to the MS-DOS
emulator originally written by Matthias Lautner.  Note that the term
MS-DOS "emulator" is a misnomer, as you must have a copy of MS-DOS to
boot it.  I doubt this is a problem for anybody.
  Suggestions for less misleading names are welcome.

There have been a lot of questions about using WordPerfect under dosemu.
As of dosemu 0.48, you can.  If you didn't see my post on how to make
WordPerfect run under dosemu, mail me and I'll send it to you.
(Basically, just set the screen mode to "Text Only").

Here are some of the changes since version 0.47.7:
=========================================================================
  * "dir /w" actually comes out right now (finally).  This also means
    any errors in DOS STDOUT redirection (i.e. type file > file2) should
    be fixed.
  * that hold-alt-and-type-on-the-keypad numeric keypad entry methos works
    in RAW keyboard mode.
  * along with this, almost all RAW keyboard mode keys should work (ctrl/alt
    cursor keys, etc).
  * fixes to get WordPerfect to work.
  * fixes to get EDLIN to work (whee) including the proper handling of ctrl-c
    while in a DOS read char/string call.
  * some of the fixes needed to get QBASIC/EDIT to work (this is primarily
    the addition of hardware keyboard access emulation, and is nowhere near
    completion)
  * partial XMS...put "dos=high,umb" in your config.sys and
    watch the fun begin.  Works great for 4DOS.
  * a pseudo-timer tick has been implemented...all it does is update the
    BIOS tick counter at 0040:006c.  This is apparently a big deal
    to a lot of programs, so if they just froze before, try them again.
  * a lot of little things here and there.
  * most of the important CMOS RAM has been implemented, with the
    exception of the Real Time Clock alarm.
  * a tentative man page
=========================================================================

Thanks to all you who are bravely risking your filesystems, your
machines, nay, your very lives, to help me test this thing.

Read README.first for details.  Read the Makefile for help on configuration.

I hope this satisfies all you DOS losers, er, users for a while.  I'm 
gonna take some time to actually do my schoolwork, get some rest, smell
the flowers.  

I'd like to say the next release will be the big bad dosemu I've
envisioned, but I doubt it will.  I will eventually have the console
graphics working, and I'll finish the XMS UMB support, maybe even find the
time to get the keyboard and timer hardware emulation working.  But
it'll be several weeks before that happens.
