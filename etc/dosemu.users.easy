# This is a sample /etc/dosemu.users file
# Here you can restrict access to dosemu
#
# However, THIS ONE DOES ALLOW ALL WEIRD THINGS !!!
# For a more secure one look at ./etc/dosemu.users.secure
# 
# Format:
#
#   [ <login> | all ] [ confvar [ confvar [ ... ] ] ]
#
#   <login>  the login name of a user
#   confvar  under this name a configuration variable is set which
#            can be checked via 'ifdef' in /etc/dosemu.conf
#            Variables starting with 'c_' define class permission
#
# For more details look at ./doc/README.txt
