To install binary:

   Move the executable file 'garrot.com' inside DOSEMU. Make sure it
   is in your path.

To build binary:

   You will require an assembler which understands IBM Intel assembler
   syntax. Borland's TASM, Microsoft MASM, and QuickAssembler should
   work. Check the flags in the Makefile and then do 'make'.


   Don't forget to read the README doc!
