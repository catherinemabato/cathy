======================= DOSEMU ANNOUNCEMENT ==============================

I have put dosemu0.49.tar.Z onto tsx-11.mit.edu in the
/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu directory.

dosemu0.49.tar.Z is a collection of my enhanced sources to the MS-DOS
emulator originally written by Matthias Lautner.  Note that the term
MS-DOS "emulator" is a misnomer, as you must have a copy of MS-DOS to
boot it.  I doubt this is a problem for anybody.
  Suggestions for less misleading names are welcome.

There have been a lot of questions about using WordPerfect under dosemu.
As of dosemu 0.48, you can.  If you didn't see my post on how to make
WordPerfect run under dosemu, mail me and I'll send it to you.
(Basically, just set the screen mode to "Text Only").

Here are some of the changes since version 0.48pl1:

Thanks to all you who are bravely risking your filesystems, your
machines, nay, your very lives, to help me test this thing.

Read README.first for details.  Read the Makefile for help on configuration.
A quick tip:
  make config; make dep; make clean; make install

This release was a fairly major change, so there are probably new bugs.
Feel free to scream my way if you find any.
