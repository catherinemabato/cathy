From Tim Bird (Tim_R_Bird@Novell.COM) :

LREDIR allows you to redirect any drive, including one that is currently a
physical drive, meaning that you can replace a drive with a redirected one.
When you delete the redirection, the physical drive is again visible.  I am
currently using this so that the boot diskimage disappears, and is replaced by
the mounted MSDOS file system in Linux, with the drive letter and root the same
as when I just boot DOS.  People who use LREDIR in this way should be careful
when they use LREDIR in the autoexec, because COMMAND.COM will continue parsing
the autoexec.bat from the redirected drive as the same file offset where it
left off in the autoexec.bat on the physical drive.  For this reason, it is
safest to have the autoexec.bat on the redirected drive and the physical drive
(diskimage) be the same.
