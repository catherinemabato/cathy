  LINPKT.COM: a Partial emulation of the packet driver interface for
			    Linux DOSEMU.


This is based on the Crynwr packet driver skeleton by Russ Nelson et.
al.  The Crynwr drivers are excellent, whereas this program barely
works.

But since it is based on the Crynwr skeleton, and since I want anybody
who wants it to have free access to the code, it is obviously covered
by the GPL.  You can do whatever you want with it, but you can't
prevent someone from having free access to it.

Included is a makefile that works with Borland make and TASM, so if
you have these programs, you only need to do "make linpkt.com," if you
want to modify LINPKT.

LINPKT will NOT allow you to load a user level TCP/IP stack like in
TRUMPET, GOPHER, NUPOP, NCSA Telnet.

LINPKT does only the bare bones of packet driver emulation.  It always
returns a handle of (1), and it only sends and receives 802.3 packets,
since it was built solely to run PDIPX and NETX.

LINPKT is assembled based upon the assumption that the dos_helper
function is 0e6h, if this changes, LINPKT will need to be re assembled.

LINPKT should be made to allow you to load it at different INTs but
right now, it always loads at 60h and 61h, where the PKT DRVR is at
60, and a little ISR is at 61 that helps with the process of calling
back to the receiver when a packet comes in.
