How to quickly get dosemu up and running:

*** Note: This release redirects stderr, not stdout as before, therefore
	attempts to redirect the debug output should be done on stderr.
	This has been in preparation for a future release including
	ncurses support. (ie dos 2>err not dos >err)

*** Note: If no redirection is made of the stderr, it will be
	automatically redirected to /dev/null.

*** Note: This release has changed the dos_helper() function's interrupt
	and therefore if you have a version of dosemu <0.49pl4, you'll
	need to replace all the dosemu utilities. (i.e. emufs.sys, ems.sys
	lredir.exe, etc...)

*** Note: If you've already successfully ran the dos emulator (version
0.49 pl10 or later), and could sucessfully read from your linux
partition, you may follow an abridged QuickStart procedure, detailed
after the normal QuickStart.

(Please refer to doc/announce0.49pl3 for info on patching kernel pl13[k-r].)

1) Make a DOS bootable disk:
	- Boot DOS on a system. That's standalone DOS, not DOSemu.
	- Format a diskette with 'format a: /S'
	- Copy c:\dos\fdisk.exe to the diskette
	- Copy c:\dos\sys.com to the diskette
2) Make dosemu:
	- Modify the Makefile if you need special keyboard, etc
	- Do 'make'
	- Copy an edited examples/config.dist to /etc/dosemu/config
	  You'll see many options that can be set inside the config
	- Copy exitemu.com from the ./commands subdirectory to the
	  newly formatted diskette
	- Copy ./hdimage.dist (located in dosemu0.50) to ./hdimage
	  The first disk statement in your /etc/dosemu/config should
	  point to this file.
3) Prepare DOSEMU:
	- From the dosemu0.50 directory, type dos -A
	  After some delay, dosemu should boot and show the A:> prompt.
	- From the a: drive do fdisk /mbr
	  This will add a Master Boot Record to the current dosemu C:
	  drive which is currently the hdimage file.
	- From the a: drive do sys c:
	  This will allow you to boot directly from the hdimage and not
	  require a diskette
	- type 'exitemu'
4) Go for it:
	- type dos -D-a
	- Dosemu should again boot up your installed version of DOS, 
	  this time from your hdimage.
	- From here you are on your own. Please read the documentation
	  in the ./doc subdirectory, and most of all ENJOY!!!!!
5) Something not right?:
   First read the dosemu-HOWTO for Q&A's, then if no luck ...
   Please run a session 'dos -D+a 2>debug' and send jmaclean@fox.nstn.ns.ca
   me your debug (gzip|uuencoded if large), your /etc/dosemu/config
   file, and background on the system your running (video card, linux 
   release, cpu size, memory).

6) Looking to understand DOSEMU? Read DANG, DOSEMU Altering Novice's
   Guide.

7) Wish to help out? Read DPR and see if there is anything you'd 
   like to get involved with. Maybe there is something that's not
   included in the DPR? Great, come aboard and do that :-).

Abridged QuickStart
-------------------

Follow the normal QuickStart procedure, except skip step 1) and change
step 3) to:

3) Prepare DOSEMU
        - Copy drivers/emufs.sys, drivers/ems.sys,
          commands/bootoff.com, commands/booton.com,
          commands/dumpconf.exe, commands/exitemu.com,
          commands/lredir.exe, commands/vgaoff.com, and
          commands/vgaon.com to a directory accessible to dosemu, such
          as /tmp.
          (their current directories are inaccessible since
          dosemu0.50 is not a valid msdos directory).
        - From the dosemu0.50 directory, type dos -D-a 2>/dev/null
        - Copy the above files to c:/.

  Some notes from Tim Bird (Tim_R_Bird@Novell.COM) on lredir found
in the commands subdir :

LREDIR allows you to redirect any drive, including one that is
currently a physical drive, meaning that you can replace a drive with a
redirected one. When you delete the redirection, the physical drive is
again visible. I am currently using this so that the boot diskimage
disappears, and is replaced by the mounted MSDOS file system in Linux, 
with the drive letter and root the same as when I just boot DOS.  
People who use LREDIR in this way should be careful when they use 
LREDIR in the autoexec, because COMMAND.COM will continue parsing
the autoexec.bat from the redirected drive as the same file offset
where it left off in the autoexec.bat on the physical drive. For 
this reason, it is safest to have the autoexec.bat on the 
redirected drive and the physical drive (diskimage) be the same.
 
Many thanks to all involved, including all those who submitted debug
output for my viewing pleasure, keep it coming.
